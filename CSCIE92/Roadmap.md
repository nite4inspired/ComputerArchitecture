# CSCI E-92 Spring 2024 – 12-Week Study Plan

This structured 12-week schedule breaks down lectures, readings, assignments, and labs for **CSCI E-92: Principles of Operating Systems (Spring 2024)**. It balances the workload each week and integrates all course materials (lectures, textbook readings, programming assignments, and hardware labs) to ensure steady progress through the semester. Each week’s goals are outlined below:

## Week 1: Course Introduction & Setup

- **Lecture Topics:** Overview of operating systems and course logistics (syllabus, grading, prerequisites). Introduction to the course project and tools. Begin review of C programming basics (to refresh pointers, data types, etc.) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=New%20Material%20for%20this%20Week,through%20the%20Expression%20Evaluation%20slide)) since assignments will involve C coding.
- **Required Readings:** Chapter 1 of _Modern Operating Systems_ (Tanenbaum, 5th ed.) – introduction to OS concepts. Skim the syllabus and course website for an outline of topics and schedule ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=Required%20Readings%20%E2%80%A2%20Refer%20to,before%20each%20class%20meeting%2011)).
- **Lab/Practical:** Set up your development environment. Install required software (e.g. CodeWarrior IDE) and version control tools. Establish a GitHub account and install Git ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=Problem%20Set%200%20%E2%80%A2%20Complete,a%20merge%20request%2C%20add%20the)). If you’re using an ARM-based Mac, set up a Windows VM and J-Link as instructed ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20See%20class%20website%20at,91%2F%20and)). Ensure you obtain the required hardware (Freescale NXP TWR-K70F120M board, serial cable, microSD card, etc.) early ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20If%20available%2C%20the%20TWR,may%20be%20difficult%20or%20impossible)) for upcoming labs.
- **Assignments:** **Problem Set 0** handed out – a warm-up covering the course questionnaire and simple programming tasks ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=Problem%20Set%20and%20Term%20Project,microseconds%20since%20the%20Unix%20epoch)). Complete the following by the end of Week 1: fill out the course questionnaire, fix the bugs in the provided “fix-this-program” code, and write a word-count program ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=Problem%20Set%200%20%E2%80%A2%20Complete,a%20merge%20request%2C%20add%20the)). Set up your Git repository for the course (create a branch named “problem-set-0” and make your first commit/merge request) as directed. _PS0 is due by Sunday of this week (Jan 28, 2024) at midnight ET_ ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=appropriate%20comment%20%E2%80%A2%20Due%20this,28th%2C%202024%20at%20midnight%20ET)).

## Week 2: OS Fundamentals & Basic UNIX Commands

- **Lecture Topics:** Processes and operating system structures. Cover fundamental OS concepts like processes, system calls, and the overall structure of an OS kernel ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Problem%20Set%201%20%E2%80%A2,Provided%2C%20OS%20Structure%20%E2%80%A2%20Processes)). The instructor may also continue the C language review (expressions, pointers, memory allocation) to ensure all students are comfortable in C.
- **Required Readings:** Chapter 2 of _Modern Operating Systems_ – focusing on process management and threads. Before class, read about how OSes manage processes and context switches ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=Required%20Readings%20%E2%80%A2%20Refer%20to,before%20each%20class%20meeting%2011)). This will prepare you for implementing a simple shell soon.
- **Lab/Practical:** Familiarize yourself with the UNIX environment and commands. Since upcoming assignments involve writing a shell and using UNIX system calls, practice basic shell commands and simple C system call usage (e.g. try fork, exec, etc., in small test programs). Ensure your development environment from Week 1 is fully functional by compiling and running a simple C program.
- **Assignments:** **Problem Set 1** is assigned this week. It includes written textbook problems on processes and a coding project to build a simple shell interpreter ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=Problem%20Set%20and%20Term%20Project,microseconds%20since%20the%20Unix%20epoch)) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=microseconds%20since%20the%20Unix%20epoch,LED%20flashing%20program%2C%20shell%20enhancements)). One specific task is converting a timestamp (microseconds since the Unix epoch) to a human-readable form ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Problem%20Set%201%3A%20textbook,microseconds%20since%20the%20Unix%20epoch)) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=microseconds%20since%20the%20Unix%20epoch,LED%20flashing%20program%2C%20shell%20enhancements)). Start early by breaking the shell task into parsing input, executing commands, etc. _PS1 will be due by the end of Week 3 (Sunday, Feb 11, 2024)_ ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Due%20at%20midnight%20ET,delayed%20to%20next%20week%2019)), so plan to finish the coding and textbook questions by then.

## Week 3: Memory Management & Hardware Setup

- **Lecture Topics:** Memory management concepts (Chapter 3). Discuss dynamic memory allocation, heaps, and how malloc/free work internally. If time permits, cover basics of paging and memory protection, which lay groundwork for later topics. Also review any remaining process concepts from last week.
- **Required Readings:** Chapter 3 of _Modern Operating Systems_ – sections on memory management policies, allocation algorithms, and paging. These concepts will directly apply to the upcoming assignment on writing your own malloc/free ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L705%20%E2%80%A2%20Due,free%2C%20memorymap%2C%20memset%20%26%20memchk)).
- **Lab/Practical:** **Embedded system setup:** Install the NXP CodeWarrior toolchain and any device drivers for the K70 board (if you haven’t already) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Before%20next%20week%E2%80%99s%20class,Drivers%20%E2%80%A2%20Connect%20Hardware%20Devices)). Connect the K70 tower kit to your development PC and verify the connection. By the end of this week, **get the hardware working** – build and run a simple example on the board (e.g. an LED blinking program) to confirm your toolchain and board are configured correctly ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=Get%20Hardware%20Working%20before%20Next,1)). This will prepare you for the hardware-oriented parts of the next assignment.
- **Assignments:** **Problem Set 1** is due this week (Feb 11) – submit your answers and shell program ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Due%20at%20midnight%20ET,delayed%20to%20next%20week%2019)). **Problem Set 2** is now assigned, focusing on memory management and basic device I/O ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L705%20%E2%80%A2%20Due,free%2C%20memorymap%2C%20memset%20%26%20memchk)). In PS2, you will implement your own versions of `malloc()` and `free()`, answer a few questions on page-replacement algorithms, and write a small program to flash an LED on the K70 board ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L705%20%E2%80%A2%20Due,free%2C%20memorymap%2C%20memset%20%26%20memchk)). This assignment integrates a simple hardware lab (LED blinking) with OS concepts. Aim to complete the memory allocator code this week and begin the K70 LED exercise once your board is set up. _PS2 is due by the end of Week 5 (Sunday, Feb 25, 2024)_ ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L705%20%E2%80%A2%20Due,free%2C%20memorymap%2C%20memset%20%26%20memchk)).

## Week 4: File Systems & Device Drivers Basics

- **Lecture Topics:** File systems (Chapter 4) and introduction to device drivers. Learn about how operating systems organize files, directories, and manage disk I/O. Discuss the basics of file system implementation (allocation tables, directories) and how device drivers interface with hardware. These topics will soon be applied when implementing a simple file system on the K70.
- **Required Readings:** Chapter 4 of _Modern Operating Systems_ – sections on file system architecture and implementation. Focus on how FAT and similar file systems work, as the K70 will use a FAT32 file system on a microSD card in a later project. Also review any provided documentation on the K70’s SD card interface and serial ports (the instructor may supply additional reading on these hardware specifics).
- **Lab/Practical:** Continue working on **PS2’s lab components**. This week, test and refine your K70 LED flash program and integrate it with your code. Make sure your custom `malloc/free` functions work correctly by writing test cases or using the provided shell commands (PS2 requires adding shell commands like `malloc`, `free`, `memorymap`, etc. to exercise your memory manager) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Due%20at%20midnight%20ET,free%2C%20memorymap%2C%20memset%20%26%20memchk)). If sample projects (e.g. DataSizes, FlashLED, Pushbuttons) were provided on the course website, run those on your board to gain familiarity with I/O and basic electronics on the K70.
- **Assignments:** Continue and **complete Problem Set 2**, which is due at the end of next week ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L705%20%E2%80%A2%20Due,free%2C%20memorymap%2C%20memset%20%26%20memchk)). By now you should have the memory management portion mostly done; use this week to finish the LED flashing and shell integration parts. No new problem set is assigned this week, but you should also start reviewing earlier material for the upcoming midterm. (The midterm will cover all topics through file systems, i.e. Chapters 1–6 ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Readings%20in%20Tanenbaum%205%2Fe%3A,Website%20%E2%80%A2%20Discussions%20on%20Ed)).)

## Week 5: I/O Systems & Midterm Prep

- **Lecture Topics:** Device management and I/O (Chapter 5). Cover how operating systems handle input/output, including interrupt handling, device controllers, and driver frameworks. This ties directly into what you’ve started doing with the K70. Also discuss storage management and introduce the basics of FAT32 (since you’ll use a FAT32 file system on the microSD card in the next assignment). The latter part of the lecture is devoted to **midterm exam review** – the instructor will highlight key concepts from Weeks 1–5 (processes, memory, file systems, I/O) and answer questions.
- **Required Readings:** Chapter 5 of _Modern Operating Systems_ – focus on sections about device drivers and interrupt handling. Review earlier chapters (1–4) to reinforce your understanding. It’s also recommended to read the FAT32 file system overview (the instructor may have posted an article or notes on FAT32) to prepare for implementing it on the K70.
- **Lab/Practical:** Finish up any remaining tasks from PS2 and ensure your environment is ready for more complex device interactions. If you have time, familiarize yourself with the K70’s SD card slot: for example, ensure you have a formatted microSDHC card and try mounting it on a PC to understand its file system. This will make the next assignment easier.
- **Assignments:** **Problem Set 2** is due by Sunday this week (Feb 25) – submit your memory manager code and LED test as required ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L705%20%E2%80%A2%20Due,free%2C%20memorymap%2C%20memset%20%26%20memchk)). Take the time now to **prepare for the midterm exam**. The midterm will cover Chapters 1–6 of Tanenbaum ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Readings%20in%20Tanenbaum%205%2Fe%3A,Website%20%E2%80%A2%20Discussions%20on%20Ed)) (everything up to and including this week’s lecture) and associated labs/assignments. No new programming assignment is given this week so you can focus on studying. Review your lecture notes, slides, and ensure you understand the solutions to PS0–PS2. It may help to attempt additional end-of-chapter problems as practice. _(The midterm exam will take place during Week 7 and replace the normal class meeting.)_

## Week 6: Deadlocks & Problem Set 3 Launch

- **Lecture Topics:** Deadlocks and resource management (Chapter 6). Learn the conditions for deadlock, prevention and avoidance strategies (e.g. banker’s algorithm), and how modern OSes handle deadlocks (usually by avoidance or detection/recovery). This completes the core OS theory portion that will be directly tested on the midterm. The instructor will also wrap up any remaining exam review. Finally, **Problem Set 3** is introduced (as it will span the midterm period). PS3 involves device-independent I/O and a file system, so the instructor will explain the expectations and give an overview of the K70 hardware features needed (serial communication, SD card interface, etc.).
- **Required Readings:** Chapter 6 of _Modern Operating Systems_ – focus on deadlocks. Since this is the last chapter covered by the midterm, ensure you’ve read and understood Chapters 1–6 thoroughly. After the midterm, reading assignments will shift to advanced or supplemental materials (e.g. documentation for the K70 board and specific OS features). If provided, start reading the K70 reference manual sections on the SD card (FAT32) file system and serial I/O, to support your work on PS3.
- **Lab/Practical:** No new lab exercise is due this week apart from preparing for the upcoming assignment. Use any extra time to make sure your K70 setup is fully ready for more intense use: for instance, double-check that your serial connection to the board works and that you can read/write from the microSD card using example code. This preparation will pay off when you begin implementing the file system in PS3.
- **Assignments:** There is no homework due this week (aside from studying); however, the **midterm exam** is scheduled for next week. Ensure you are comfortable with all material through deadlocks. **Problem Set 3** is officially assigned now so that you can start planning it ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,%E2%80%A2%20Present%20Problem%20Set%203)). _PS3 is the most time-consuming assignment of the course_ ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Has%20been%20extended%20for,drive%20using%20the%20supplied%20code)) – it will involve implementing device-independent I/O for the K70 (LEDs and pushbuttons) and a FAT32 file system on the microSDHC card, and integrating these into your shell ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Problem%20Set%202%3A%20memory,and%20a%20FAT32%20file%20system)). Although PS3 will be due after the midterm (initially scheduled for Mar 17), you are **strongly advised to start early** ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,%E2%80%A2%20Present%20Problem%20Set%203)). Read through the PS3 specification and design your approach now, even if you postpone heavy coding until after the exam. _(Midterm Exam covers chapters 1–6 and will be taken in Week 7. Problem Set 3 is due in Week 9, with an initial target of Mar 17 – later extended to Mar 24 ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Has%20been%20extended%20for,drive%20using%20the%20supplied%20code)).)_

## Week 7: **Midterm Exam Week** (no lecture)

- **Lecture:** _No class meeting this week._ The midterm exam is being held during this week in lieu of the regular lecture. (The exam is a 3-hour online assessment which you can start between Tue Mar 5 and Wed Mar 6 ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L1482%20%E2%80%A2%20Earliest,6th%2C%202024%20even%20if%20you)). Once started, you have 3 hours to complete it.) There are no new topics introduced in Week 7.
- **Required Readings:** _None (exam week)._ If anything, you might use the time before your exam session for final review of notes and textbook chapters 1–6.
- **Lab/Practical:** _No new lab._ Once you have completed the midterm exam, you should turn your attention back to **Problem Set 3**. This is a good time to begin coding and testing parts of PS3 now that the exam is out of the way. For example, start by porting your shell and memory allocator from PS2 into the K70 environment (getting them to run on the board) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,shell%20to%20the%20K70%20hardware)). Set up basic device I/O: ensure you can read input from the serial console and blink LEDs using a unified interface, as PS3 requires making I/O device access device-independent.
- **Assignments:** **Midterm Exam:** Complete the midterm according to the instructions and submit it by the deadline. After the exam, **continue working on Problem Set 3**, which is due next week. Try to have a prototype of reading/writing files on the SD card and handling input/output via the serial port by the end of this week. Keep in mind the PS3 due date was extended by one week to give you extra time ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Has%20been%20extended%20for,drive%20using%20the%20supplied%20code)) – the new due date is end of Week 9 (Sunday Mar 24). Use this extension wisely; aim to finish a substantial portion of PS3 by the original due date (Mar 17) so that the extra week can be used for testing and debugging.

## Week 8: Device I/O & File Systems Integration

- **Lecture Topics:** Post-midterm, the course shifts focus to applying OS concepts on the K70 hardware. This week covers **device drivers and file system integration** in depth. The lecture will discuss the design of a **device-independent I/O layer** – how to abstract different devices (LEDs, buttons, serial console, SD card) under a common interface ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Problem%20Set%202%3A%20memory,and%20a%20FAT32%20file%20system)). Also covered is the FAT32 file system structure (FAT, directories, sector reading/writing) since PS3 involves implementing a tiny FAT32 file system on the microSD card. The instructor may demonstrate or walk through sample code for reading from and writing to the FAT32 file system. Expect discussion on how to use the provided “shell commands” to interact with the file system and devices.
- **Required Readings:** Instead of textbook chapters, focus on **supplemental materials**: the class website’s notes on the K70 hardware and any provided documentation for the SD card/FAT32 implementation. Make sure you understand how the K70’s UART (serial port) works, as PS3 requires using UART for all shell input/output. Review any example code for FAT32 handling. (Refer to the course website’s “Approximate Schedule” for specific required readings before this class ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=Required%20Readings%20%E2%80%A2%20Refer%20to,before%20each%20class%20meeting%2011)).)
- **Lab/Practical:** **Complete Problem Set 3 lab work.** By now you should be integrating all pieces on the K70: your shell should use UART for input/output, you should be able to list directory contents of the microSD (reading the FAT32), and control the LEDs and buttons via your device-independent interface. Test all functionalities thoroughly on the hardware. This is a heavy lab week as you push to finalize PS3. If you run into issues, use office hours or Ed Discussion. Also, start thinking ahead: the **Term Project Proposal** assignment is coming due soon (next week). Take some time this week to brainstorm project ideas and discuss feasibility with the teaching staff ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,working%20on%20other%20class%20work)). (The term project requires you to design and implement an advanced OS feature of your choice – begin formulating what you want to do so you can write the proposal.)
- **Assignments:** **Problem Set 3** is due at the end of this week (Sunday, Mar 24, 2024) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Has%20been%20extended%20for,drive%20using%20the%20supplied%20code)). Submit your code and documentation for the device I/O and FAT32 file system implementation. This is a major milestone – you will have a simple operating system running on the K70 by this point. No new problem set will be _due_ this week; however, **Problem Set 4** will be assigned now to keep up momentum. PS4 builds on your OS by adding more advanced hardware features ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Problem%20Set%204%3A%20K70,sensors%2C%20unprivileged%20mode%2C%20shell%20enhancements)). It will involve enabling the K70’s _off-chip SDRAM_ and faster clock, implementing _supervisor calls (SVC)_ for system calls, adding serial I/O into the device-independent layer (so that file and console I/O go through common interfaces), possibly integrating the K70 touch sensors and an (optional) LCD display, and introducing a user/supervisor mode separation ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Problem%20Set%204%3A%20K70,6%3A%20SysTick%20for%20multiprocessing%2C%20processes)). _PS4 will be due by the end of Week 10 (Sunday, Mar 31, 2024)_ ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,chip%20SDRAM)), which is just one week from now, so it’s important to start immediately. Also, the **Term Project Proposal** assignment is officially announced: your one-page proposal outlining the advanced OS feature you plan to implement is _due at the end of Week 10 (Sunday, Apr 7)_ ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,working%20on%20other%20class%20work)). This week, draft your proposal and seek feedback (you have two weeks to refine it).

## Week 9: Advanced Hardware Features & Term Project Planning

- **Lecture Topics:** **Enhancing the OS with hardware features.** This week’s lecture dives into the advanced enhancements you’ll implement in PS4. Topics include using the K70’s **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to increase the clock speed** (and the implications on timers/delays), interfacing with **off-chip SDRAM** (memory mapping and uses of external RAM), and implementing **system calls via Supervisor Calls (SVC)** ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Problem%20Set%204%3A%20K70,6%3A%20SysTick%20for%20multiprocessing%2C%20processes)) to allow user-mode programs to request OS services. The concept of user mode vs. privileged mode is discussed, which ties into operating system protection mechanisms. If time permits, the instructor will also touch on the K70 **touch sensors and analog-to-digital (A/D) inputs**, as those are part of the optional enhancements in PS4 ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Problem%20Set%204%3A%20K70,sensors%2C%20unprivileged%20mode%2C%20shell%20enhancements)). This lecture essentially prepares you for all tasks in Problem Set 4. Additionally, there will be discussion on term projects – what makes a good advanced OS feature, and perhaps examples of project ideas, to help students finalize their proposals.
- **Required Readings:** There may not be a specific textbook chapter this week, as the focus is on hardware documentation and project research. Review the Freescale K70 technical reference manual sections relevant to this week’s topics (clock/PLL configuration, memory controller for SDRAM, the SVC instruction on ARM Cortex-M4). Also read any course notes on implementing system calls. These will help in completing PS4.
- **Lab/Practical:** **Problem Set 4 development.** This week you will implement and test the new features on the K70: Increase the CPU clock frequency and verify the system still runs stable; configure and test the external SDRAM (for example, modify your memory allocator to use the larger off-chip memory); implement at least one system call using SVC (perhaps for a privileged operation like writing to device registers); and add any required shell commands or device drivers (e.g., for the serial port if not done, or reading touch sensor input). This is a packed set of tasks, so break it down and test incrementally. By mid-week, aim to have the clock and SDRAM working; by end-week, SVC and other enhancements. In parallel, finish writing your **Term Project Proposal** – ensure you clearly describe the OS feature you plan to implement and how you’ll approach it.
- **Assignments:** **Problem Set 4** is due at the end of this week (Mar 31, 2024) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,chip%20SDRAM)). Submit your updated OS code with all the K70 enhancements (faster clock, SDRAM support, SVC, etc.). Because PS4 had a very short timeline, you might still be debugging up to the deadline – do your best to complete it, but note that it builds essential groundwork for the next assignments. Also, **Term Project Proposal** is due at the end of this week (Sunday, Apr 7) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,working%20on%20other%20class%20work)). Make sure to submit your proposal on time, detailing the advanced feature you intend to add to your OS for the term project. (For now, just propose and outline the work; implementation will happen in the coming weeks once approved.) After submitting PS4, you can breathe a little – the next assignment will be given a slightly longer span.

## Week 10: Time Management & Interrupts in OS

- **Lecture Topics:** **OS Timekeeping and Timers.** Now that the system is running with many basic OS features, we turn to managing time and timers. The lecture covers how an operating system keeps track of time (system ticks, timers, scheduling timer interrupts). Specifically, you will learn to use the K70’s **FlexTimer module** to maintain the current date and time in the OS ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,maintain%20current%20time%20and%20date)). The concept of timer interrupts and how to handle them in an OS context is discussed. The instructor will also cover the implementation of **interrupt-driven serial I/O** ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Problem%20Set%205%3A%20FlexTimer,as%20approved%20for%20each%20student)) (as opposed to any polling you may have done) – ensuring your shell’s UART input/output is interrupt-based for efficiency. Additionally, the notion of a **“user timer”** is introduced (a timer that a user program can set, which ties into the term project for some students). With these, the OS will be able to provide timer services and more shell commands (like a “sleep” or “alarm” command). Toward the end, the class might briefly discuss the results of PS4 and address any common issues. Also, since term project proposals were due, the instructor may give general feedback or approval status for project ideas.
- **Required Readings:** Focus on any provided **FlexTimer documentation** (the course site or section handouts should have specifics on how to program the K70 FlexTimer for periodic interrupts). Also review the concept of **interrupt handling** in an OS (Tanenbaum’s earlier chapters on I/O interrupts can be useful here). If available, read the course notes on implementing a clock in the OS (maintaining a 64-bit millisecond count since a reference epoch, which is actually one of the requirements in PS5) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Was%20due%20on%20this,must%20be%20read%20and%20written)). No new textbook chapters are assigned, as the emphasis is on these specific technical references.
- **Lab/Practical:** **Begin Problem Set 5.** Now that PS4 is done, you will start PS5, which extends your OS with timing functionality. This week, set up the **FlexTimer on the K70** to generate periodic interrupts (for example, every 1 ms or 1 tick per millisecond) and write an interrupt handler that updates a global time counter. Verify that you can keep track of current time and date (perhaps by incrementing a timestamp and converting it to date/time format) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,maintain%20current%20time%20and%20date)). Next, refactor your serial I/O to be interrupt-driven: configure the UART to trigger interrupts on receiving data, and similarly handle transmit via interrupts, so that your shell I/O doesn’t busy-wait ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Problem%20Set%205%3A%20FlexTimer,as%20approved%20for%20each%20student)). Test that the shell still works with the new interrupt-driven approach. Lastly, implement a **user timer feature** – e.g., allow a user process or shell command to set a timer and get notified (maybe print a message) when it expires. This likely involves creating a system call or shell command that utilizes the FlexTimer. By the end of the week, you should have the OS keeping accurate time and responding to timer events.
- **Assignments:** **Problem Set 5** is now in progress and will be your main focus for the next two weeks. _PS5 is due by the end of Week 12 (Sunday, Apr 14, 2024)_ ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,maintain%20current%20time%20and%20date)). Its key objectives are to use the FlexTimer for timekeeping and implement interrupt-driven serial I/O, plus add any required shell enhancements (for example, commands to display time or set timers) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,maintain%20current%20time%20and%20date)). Continue to build incrementally: ensure each new feature (timer, interrupts) works before moving on. Also, by now you should have received feedback on your term project proposal. **Begin implementation of your term project** in the background. Allocate a small amount of time each week to the term project so that you’re not rushing it at the very end. For example, set up a separate project repository or branch and scaffold the basic structure of your project’s code this week. (If your project is an “advanced OS feature,” perhaps begin with small experiments related to it.)

## Week 11: Multiprocessing & Scheduling

- **Lecture Topics:** **Multiprocessing and Scheduling**. This week you’ll tackle the core concept of having multiple processes on your K70 system. The lecture covers scheduling algorithms (round-robin, priority scheduling, etc.) and the implementation of a simple scheduler. You’ll learn about the ARM **SysTick timer** and how it can be used to trigger context switches at a fixed interval (time quantum) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,robin%20scheduler)). The instructor will discuss how to maintain **process control blocks (PCBs)** for each process, and how to perform a context switch on the K70 (saving and restoring registers, stack pointers, etc.). Essentially, this is about adding a basic multitasking capability to the OS. This is the last major piece of functionality for the course’s OS project. After covering scheduling, the lecture might also include guidance on finalizing term projects, as well as a brief overview of any remaining advanced OS topics (for instance, security or virtualization, if time allows, though these may be just cursory due to focus on the project).
- **Required Readings:** If you haven’t already, read the sections of Tanenbaum (or provided notes) on CPU scheduling and context switching (this may have been partially covered in Chapter 2, but revisit it now in the context of implementation). Also review any documentation on the SysTick timer in the ARM Cortex-M4 – understanding how to configure SysTick for periodic interrupts (e.g., 100 Hz for a 10 ms quantum, or similar) will be important. The course website or section handouts likely provide guidance for context switching on the K70; read those thoroughly.
- **Lab/Practical:** **Complete Problem Set 5 and advance to Problem Set 6.** First, ensure you finish up PS5 by the due date (Apr 14). Test that your OS correctly keeps time and that the interrupt-driven I/O is robust (no missed characters or buffer issues). Once PS5 is submitted, focus on **Problem Set 6**, which introduces true multiprocessing. Start by implementing the **SysTick timer** to generate a timer interrupt at the scheduling interval ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,robin%20scheduler)). Then implement a simple **round-robin scheduler**: maintain a list (or table) of processes/threads and on each SysTick interrupt, perform a context switch to the next process ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20this,scheduler%20%E2%80%A2%20Full%20PCB%20implementation)). You will need to create dummy processes or tasks to demonstrate multitasking – for example, two tasks that blink different LEDs or print messages at intervals, to show they run “in parallel.” Implement process creation (if required, maybe as part of initialization you create a few processes). A full PCB (process control block) structure should be set up to store each process’s state (register values, stack pointer, etc.) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20this,scheduler%20%E2%80%A2%20Full%20PCB%20implementation)). This is one of the most challenging coding tasks; proceed carefully and test incrementally. By the end of this week, you should have a basic multitasking OS kernel running on the K70.
- **Assignments:** **Problem Set 5** is due at the start of this week (Apr 14) – submit your timer and interrupt I/O code ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,maintain%20current%20time%20and%20date)). Now concentrate on **Problem Set 6**, which is the final problem set, due at the end of Week 12 (Sunday, Apr 28, 2024) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,robin%20scheduler)). PS6 involves adding a round-robin scheduler using SysTick and demonstrating multiple concurrent processes ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Problem%20Set%205%3A%20FlexTimer,as%20approved%20for%20each%20student)) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,robin%20scheduler)). It’s recommended to finish the bulk of PS6 by the end of this week, so that you have time for polishing and for your term project. In parallel, **work on your term project**: with your proposal approved, implement the advanced OS feature you chose. Aim to have a prototype or major components completed by the end of this week. (For example, if your project is adding a priority scheduler, you might integrate that instead of round-robin; if it’s adding a new device or OS feature, get the core functionality working now.) Coordinate with the course staff if you need any help or clarification on your project. Remember, the term project will be presented next week, so preparation is key.

## Week 12: Final Integration and Presentation Preparation

- **Lecture Topics:** **Course Wrap-up and Advanced Topics.** In the final week of the course, the formal lecture is minimal to allow time for project presentations and final integration. The instructor will likely review the overall architecture you’ve built: a summary of how the simple OS now includes process management, memory management, file system, device drivers, and timing. Any remaining advanced OS topics or current trends (e.g. a brief look at virtualization or security in OS) might be discussed for context, but the focus is on consolidation of knowledge. This session may include **presentations or demos of selected term projects**, or at least a Q&A where each student briefly describes their project. Expect also a course summary and advice on further learning.
- **Required Readings:** No new readings. You should utilize this time to finalize all written documentation for your project and readme files for your code. If your term project involves aspects not covered in class, you might be reading research papers or documentation specific to that – but that’s self-directed based on your project.
- **Lab/Practical:** **Final Testing and Integration.** This week, finish **Problem Set 6** and perform comprehensive testing of your OS. Make sure multiple processes can run and switch correctly (no crashes, and each process resumes correctly on its turn) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20this,scheduler%20%E2%80%A2%20Full%20PCB%20implementation)). Test all features together: for example, run the shell concurrently with a blinking LED process to ensure the system is stable. Once you’re confident in PS6, focus on your **Term Project implementation**. Integrate your advanced OS feature into the codebase. Conduct thorough tests of your project feature and prepare a demonstration. You should also prepare a short presentation or demo script for your term project. Practice explaining the problem your feature solves, your design, and a quick demo of it working.
- **Assignments:** **Problem Set 6** is due by Sunday of this week (Apr 28, 2024) ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Is%20due%20on%20Sunday%2C,robin%20scheduler)). Submit your final code for the multi-process scheduler. With that, all problem sets (PS0–PS6) are complete, and you have a rudimentary but functional operating system for the K70! The remaining task is the **Term Project Presentation: each student will present their advanced OS feature implementation** ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Problem%20Set%206%3A%20SysTick,as%20approved%20for%20each%20student)). The presentations may be scheduled in this week’s class or during exam week (coordinate with your instructor on exact timing). Ensure your **term project report/code** is submitted as required and be ready to demonstrate it. This is the capstone of the course, where you showcase the additional OS capability you chose to build – whether it’s a new scheduling policy, a device driver, a networking stack, or any approved feature. After presentations, congratulate yourself on completing CSCI E-92!

### Note:

Throughout the course, balance your workload by starting assignments early and working steadily. The schedule above integrates lectures, readings, and labs so that each problem set’s theory is covered in lecture **before** or during the time you are implementing it. Always do the required readings before each class ([CSCI E-92, Spring 2017: Principles of Operating Systems Agenda for 24-Jan-2017](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/spring2024/Class%20Agenda.pdf#:~:text=Required%20Readings%20%E2%80%A2%20Refer%20to,before%20each%20class%20meeting%2011)), as it will make the lectures easier to follow and the assignments easier to implement. By following this week-by-week plan, you will gradually build a working understanding of operating systems and complete all course deliverables without cramming. Good luck, and enjoy the process of building your own operating system!
