# Undergraduate Electrical Engineering Curriculum Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a **four-year** undergraduate EE curriculum, drawing on **MIT and Stanford** course structures. It is organized by academic year, with each semester’s courses listed alongside **textbooks or course materials** (favoring those used in official MIT/Stanford syllabi). Core math and science foundations come first, followed by electrical engineering fundamentals, labs/design experiences, and advanced electives.

## Freshman Year – Foundations in Math, Science, and Programming

**Fall Semester:**

- **Calculus I (Single Variable Calculus)** – Introduction to differentiation and integration of single-variable functions. _Textbook:_ _Calculus with Analytic Geometry_ (2nd ed.) by George F. Simmons ([Readings | Single Variable Calculus | Mathematics | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/pages/readings/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CText%E2%80%9D%20refers%20to%20the%20course,ISBN%3A%209780070576421)) – the same text used in MIT’s 18.01.
    
- **Physics I (Mechanics)** – Newtonian mechanics, kinematics, and dynamics. _Textbook:_ _Physics for Scientists and Engineers: A Strategic Approach_ by Randall D. Knight (Vol. 1, Mechanics) – Stanford’s PHYS 41 uses Knight’s text ([Marketplace for Stanford Students - SUpost](https://supost.com/search/sub/6?page=70#:~:text=Marketplace%20for%20Stanford%20Students%20,GREAT%20condition)).

- **General Chemistry (Elective Science)** – _Optional_, depending on program requirements. Introduces chemical principles for engineers (stoichiometry, reactions, thermodynamics). _Textbook:_ _Chemistry: The Central Science_ by Brown et al. (if required as a science elective). _(MIT allows any science GIR; Stanford’s EE program accepts a science elective beyond physics ([EE_PS_2425.xlsx - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19bEXs9D9Oo4Gwf9dSrTkqVIqc1LpFY1m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101265200977338772115&rtpof=true&sd=true#:~:text=29)).)_
    

**Spring Semester:**

- **Calculus II (Multivariable Calculus)** – Extension to multivariable functions (partial derivatives, multiple integrals) and vector calculus. _Textbook:_ **Simmons** (same as Calculus I) covering multivariable topics ([Readings | Single Variable Calculus | Mathematics | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/pages/readings/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CText%E2%80%9D%20refers%20to%20the%20course,ISBN%3A%209780070576421)). (MIT and Stanford continue with the same calculus text through multivariable calculus.)
    
- **Physics II (Electricity and Magnetism)** – Electrostatics, Maxwell’s equations, electromagnetic waves, and basic circuits. _Textbook:_ _Physics for Scientists and Engineers_ by R. Knight (Vol. 4, E&M) – used at Stanford for PHYS 43 ([Marketplace for Stanford Students - SUpost](https://supost.com/search/sub/6?page=70#:~:text=Marketplace%20for%20Stanford%20Students%20,GREAT%20condition)). This course builds the foundation for later EE electromagnetics.
    
- **Linear Algebra** – Vectors, matrices, linear transformations, and eigenvalues, often with applications to circuits and systems. _Textbook:_ _Introduction to Linear Algebra_ (5th ed.) by Gilbert Strang – the textbook for MIT’s 18.06 linear algebra course (MIT’s curriculum recommends 18.06 for EE majors ([Electrical Engineering with Computing (Course 6-5) | MIT Course Catalog](https://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/electrical-engineering-computing-course-6-5/#:~:text=))).
    
- **Intro to EE Seminar** – _Optional small-course:_ Overview of the EE field and professional development. (For example, Stanford’s 1-unit EE 100 seminar introduces the EE profession ([EE_PS_2425.xlsx - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19bEXs9D9Oo4Gwf9dSrTkqVIqc1LpFY1m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101265200977338772115&rtpof=true&sd=true#:~:text=Introduction%20to%20Electromagnetics%20and%20Its,see%20note%207)) ([EE_PS_2425.xlsx - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19bEXs9D9Oo4Gwf9dSrTkqVIqc1LpFY1m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101265200977338772115&rtpof=true&sd=true#:~:text=57)).) No textbook – uses guest lectures and short assignments.
    

> **Note:** By the end of Year 1, students complete core calculus and physics sequences and gain programming experience. These satisfy prerequisites for sophomore-year engineering courses. MIT’s General Institute Requirements and Stanford’s math/science core align closely here ([EE_PS_2425.xlsx - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19bEXs9D9Oo4Gwf9dSrTkqVIqc1LpFY1m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101265200977338772115&rtpof=true&sd=true#:~:text=Science%20,units)) ([EE_PS_2425.xlsx - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19bEXs9D9Oo4Gwf9dSrTkqVIqc1LpFY1m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101265200977338772115&rtpof=true&sd=true#:~:text=29)).

## Sophomore Year – Core EE Fundamentals and Advanced Math

This course provides tools for analyzing dynamic circuits and control systems.
    
- **Probability and Statistics for Engineers** – Introduction to probability theory, random variables, and statistics in EE (needed for signal processing, communications, ML). _Textbook:_ _Introduction to Probability_ by Dimitri Bertsekas & John Tsitsiklis ([[PDF] EE 178/278A Probabilistic Systems Analysis Spring 2014 Tse ...](http://stanford.edu/~dntse/classes/ee178_278a_spring14_notes/lecture1.pdf#:~:text=,1%20from%20Bertsekas%20and%20Tsitsiklis)) – the same text used in MIT’s and Stanford’s “Probabilistic Systems Analysis” course (MIT 6.041 / Stanford EE 178).
    
- **Circuits & Electronics I** – Fundamental circuit analysis and electronics. Topics: circuit laws (Kirchhoff’s laws), resistive networks, independent/dependent sources, op-amps, first-order RC/RL transients, and MOSFET switch models. _Textbook:_ _Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits_ by Anant Agarwal & Jeffrey Lang ([Circuits and Electronics | Electrical Engineering and Computer Science | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-002-circuits-and-electronics-spring-2007/#:~:text=The%20course%20uses%20the%20required,ISBN%3A%209781558607354)) – the required text for MIT’s introductory circuits course 6.002. This class includes weekly labs building and testing basic circuits (gaining hands-on design experience ([Circuits and Electronics | Electrical Engineering and Computer Science | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-002-circuits-and-electronics-spring-2007/#:~:text=covered%20include%3A%20resistive%20elements%20and,Lang))).
    
- **Digital Systems I (Logic Design)** – Introduction to digital logic and computer architecture fundamentals. Covers boolean algebra, combinational and sequential logic, finite state machines, and simple processor design. _Textbook:_ _Computation Structures_ by Stephen Ward & Robert Halstead ([6.004 Logistics - People | MIT CSAIL](https://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas/6.004/Lectures/lect1/tsld004.htm#:~:text=6,1%20Final%3A%20200%20points)) – used in MIT’s 6.004, covering digital logic through CPU design. Students typically use modern HDL tools (Verilog/VHDL) in lab assignments to implement designs on FPGAs.
    

**Spring Semester:**

- **Circuits & Electronics II (Electronic Devices and Amplifiers)** – Continuation of Circuits I focused on active analog circuits. Topics: diode and transistor device physics, transistor biasing, small-signal models, amplifier configurations, frequency response, and feedback amplifiers. _Textbook:_ _Microelectronic Circuits_ by Sedra/Smith (or similar). **Design/Lab:** Circuit design projects (e.g. multistage amplifier) are built and tested. _Reference:_ _The Art of Electronics_ (3rd ed.) by Paul Horowitz & Winfield Hill – strongly recommended in MIT’s analog electronics lab course ([Course 6.101: Analog Electronics Lab - MIT](https://web.mit.edu/6.101/www/s2019/main.html#:~:text=6,is%20strongly%20recommended)) for practical circuit design insight.

At MIT, this material is often taught with professor David Staelin’s _Electromagnetics and Applications_ course notes ([Readings | Electromagnetics and Applications | Electrical Engineering and Computer Science | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-013-electromagnetics-and-applications-spring-2009/pages/readings/#:~:text=Readings)) as the primary resource. Students gain understanding of wave phenomena critical for antennas, RF circuits, and high-speed interconnects.
    
- **Electronics/Embedded Systems Lab** – A project-based lab to complement the theory courses. For example, Stanford’s ENGR 40M (Intro to Making: Electronics) or MIT’s project labs have students build devices (like an audio amplifier, an LED gadget, or a microcontroller-based system) to practice circuit assembly, programming, and debugging. _Textbook:_ No single text – relies on lab handouts. (Students draw on knowledge from Circuits I/II; _The Art of Electronics_ ([Course 6.101: Analog Electronics Lab - MIT](https://web.mit.edu/6.101/www/s2019/main.html#:~:text=6,is%20strongly%20recommended)) serves as a handy reference during projects.)
    

> **Note:** By end of Year 2, students have completed the **core EE foundation**: DC and AC circuits, basic analog and digital design, signals and transforms, and the necessary math (linear algebra, diff-eq, probability). They have also had significant **lab exposure**, reinforcing theory with practice. For instance, MIT requires an EE lab subject for the laboratory GIR ([Electrical Engineering with Computing (Course 6-5) | MIT Course Catalog](https://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/electrical-engineering-computing-course-6-5/#:~:text=Restricted%20Electives%20in%20Science%20and,education%20courses%20for%20eight%20points)) ([Electrical Engineering with Computing (Course 6-5) | MIT Course Catalog](https://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/electrical-engineering-computing-course-6-5/#:~:text=the%20Departmental%20Program,Required%20for%20SB%20Degree%2017)), and Stanford’s curriculum includes an EE fundamentals lab (ENGR 40M) as a requirement ([EE_PS_2425.xlsx - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19bEXs9D9Oo4Gwf9dSrTkqVIqc1LpFY1m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101265200977338772115&rtpof=true&sd=true#:~:text=CS%20106B%20or%20B%2BM%20Programming,req%27d)).

## Junior Year – Advanced Core Topics and Design

**Fall Semester:**

- **Electronic Devices & Semiconductor Physics** – Introduction to semiconductor devices that drive modern electronics. Covers PN junction theory, MOSFET and BJT operation, device fabrication, and basic CMOS technology. _Textbook:_ _Solid State Electronic Devices_ by Ben Streetman & Sanjay Banerjee (6th ed.) – used in Stanford’s semiconductor devices course (EE 116, see references to “Streetman book” in course materials ([[PDF] ECE 116 Lectures 18-19](https://poplab.stanford.edu/files/ee116/L18toL21_PNjunction.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Read%20Streetman%20book%20Ch,type%20piece%20of%20semiconductor))). This course connects fundamental physics to transistor-level circuit behavior.
    
- **Feedback Control Systems** – Analysis and design of feedback control loops in electrical/mechanical systems. Topics: modeling of dynamic systems, time and frequency response, stability criteria, root locus, Bode plots, PID controllers, and state-space models. _Textbook:_ _Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems_ by Gene F. Franklin, J. D. Powell, & A. Emami-Naeini (e.g. 7th ed.) ([Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems (Addison-Wesley Series in ...](https://www.amazon.com/Feedback-Addison-Wesley-Electrical-Engineering-Engineering/dp/0201527472#:~:text=Feedback%20Control%20of%20Dynamic%20Systems,)) – a standard text (Prof. Emami-Naeini of Stanford co-authors it). Students use MATLAB to design controllers meeting stability and performance specs, complementing theoretical assignments with simulations.
    
- **Digital Systems II (Computer Architecture)** – Design of processor-based systems and computer architecture. Topics: instruction set architecture, CPU datapath and control design, pipelining, caches and memory hierarchy, and interfacing I/O. _Textbook:_ _Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface_ by David Patterson & John Hennessy ([ee180info](https://syllabus.stanford.edu/syllabus/downloadSyllabus?courseId=W24-EE-180-01#:~:text=Textbook%3A%20The%20required%20text%20for,digital%20form%20by%20online%20retailers)) – required for Stanford’s EE 180 Digital Systems Architecture. This course often includes a term project designing a simple RISC processor on an FPGA, integrating knowledge of digital logic and assembly programming.
    
- **Communication Systems** – (Often taken in junior spring or senior year; could be fall.) Introduction to analog and digital communications. Topics: amplitude and frequency modulation, sampling and quantization, baseband digital signaling, noise analysis, and basic information theory concepts. _Textbook:_ _Modern Digital and Analog Communication Systems_ by B. P. Lathi (or **Proakis & Salehi** for a more theoretical approach). (MIT’s introductory communications courses and Stanford’s electives use such texts; e.g., Stanford’s EE 133 Analog Communications Lab builds on this theory.) Students typically do lab experiments with AM/FM transmitters or software-defined radio.
    

**Spring Semester:**

- **Signals & Systems II / Digital Signal Processing** – An in-depth follow-up to the first signals course, often focusing on discrete-time signal processing. Topics: z-transform in detail, digital filter design (FIR/IIR), DFT/FFT spectral analysis, and maybe multirate signal processing. _Textbook:_ _Discrete-Time Signal Processing_ (3rd ed.) by A. Oppenheim & R. Schafer ([EE 264 Digital Signal Processing - Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee264/#:~:text=EE%20264%20Digital%20Signal%20Processing,or%20equivalent%2C%20basic%20programming)) – a widely used DSP text (Stanford’s EE 264 follows this book). The course includes computer lab assignments (e.g. filter implementation, speech or image processing tasks) to solidify concepts.
    
- **Electromagnetics II / RF & Microwaves** – Advanced treatment of electromagnetics with emphasis on engineering applications. Topics: waveguides, resonant cavities, electromagnetic interference, antennas, and wireless communication principles. _Textbook:_ _Field and Wave Electromagnetics_ by David K. Cheng (or _Microwave Engineering_ by David Pozar for a RF-focused class). (At MIT, much of this content is covered in **6.013** with Staelin’s notes ([Readings | Electromagnetics and Applications | Electrical Engineering and Computer Science | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-013-electromagnetics-and-applications-spring-2009/pages/readings/#:~:text=Readings)), while Stanford offers advanced electives like EE 142 Engineering Electromagnetics.) Students may do a design project such as designing an antenna or a matching network.
    
- **Electronics Design Lab** – A project-oriented course to synthesize analog and digital skills. For example, MIT’s 6.101 (Introductory Analog Electronics Lab) is a junior-year course where students build circuits like audio amplifiers or simple radios; it strongly recommends _The Art of Electronics_ as a reference ([Course 6.101: Analog Electronics Lab - MIT](https://web.mit.edu/6.101/www/s2019/main.html#:~:text=6,is%20strongly%20recommended)). Similarly, Stanford’s project labs (e.g., an **Analog Integrated Circuit Design Project** or an **Embedded Systems Workshop**) give practical design experience. In these labs, students work in teams to design, build, and test a device or system, documenting their work in formal reports.
    
- **Technical Elective** – By junior spring, students begin specializing. They might choose an elective in an area of interest. Common choices: **Machine Learning for Engineers** (e.g., Stanford EE 104, which introduces ML basics – no specific textbook, relies on lecture notes ([Electrical Engineering (EE)](https://archived-bulletin.stanford.mobi/coursedescriptions/ee/ee.pdf#:~:text=EE%C2%A0104,CS%20109%3B%20CS106A%20or%20equivalent))), **Embedded Systems** (building on microcontroller programming and interfacing; often using instructors’ notes or an embedded C textbook), or **Power Engineering** (covering power electronics and systems, possibly using Hart’s _Power Electronics_ text). This slot gives flexibility for students to start exploring advanced topics in preparation for a senior specialization.
    

> **Design Integration:** Throughout junior year, there is heavy emphasis on **design and integration**. Courses like Digital Systems Architecture include labs where students build and test components of a CPU, and Control Systems often involves a project (e.g. balancing a inverted pendulum or self-driving car simulation using designed controllers). By now, students have completed most core requirements and are transitioning to **in-depth electives** and capstone work. Both MIT and Stanford require students to engage in substantial lab/design work in junior year to satisfy accreditation and prepare for the capstone (MIT’s 6.3100 Dynamical Systems and 6.9000 Engineering for Impact fulfill this, while Stanford requires a designated design course in the EE major ([EE_PS_2425.xlsx - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19bEXs9D9Oo4Gwf9dSrTkqVIqc1LpFY1m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101265200977338772115&rtpof=true&sd=true#:~:text=Required%20Course)) ([EE_PS_2425.xlsx - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19bEXs9D9Oo4Gwf9dSrTkqVIqc1LpFY1m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101265200977338772115&rtpof=true&sd=true#:~:text=WIM%2FDesign%2FCapstone%20Course%20,disciplinary%20area))).

## Senior Year – Specialization and Capstone

**Fall Semester:**

- **Advanced Electives in EE:** In the final year, students choose several electives to specialize in areas of interest. Examples include:
    
    - **Advanced Signal Processing or Machine Learning:** e.g., _Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning_ by Bishop (for a machine learning elective), or _Statistical Signal Processing_ with textbooks like _Probability, Random Processes, and Estimation Theory for Engineers_.
        
    - **Communication Networks:** covering network protocols and systems (text: _Computer Networks_ by Tanenbaum, or _Data Networks_ by Bertsekas & Gallager).
        
    - **Analog Integrated Circuit Design:** a follow-on to analog electronics focusing on IC op-amp design, current mirrors, etc. (Stanford EE 114/214 uses _Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits_ by Gray, Hurst, et al. ([EE214 Advanced Analog Integrated Circuit Design: - Winter 2011](https://ro.scribd.com/document/57004805/EE214reader#:~:text=2011%20ro,Analysis%20and%20Design%20of)) ([EE214 Advanced Analog Integrated Circuit Design: - Winter 2011 ...](https://id.scribd.com/document/57004805/EE214reader#:~:text=Course%20reader%20d%20%E2%80%93%20Hardcopies,Analysis%20and%20Design%20of%20Analog)) as a primary text).
        
    - **Photonics and Optical Electronics:** introduction to lasers, fiber optics, and photonic devices (text: _Fundamentals of Photonics_ by Saleh & Teich).
        
    - **Power Systems and Energy:** covering power grids, renewable energy tech, and power electronics (text: _Power System Analysis and Design_ by Glover et al., and _Power Electronics_ by Mohan for power converters).  
        _(Students typically take 2–3 technical electives in senior year to fulfill degree depth and breadth requirements ([EE_PS_2425.xlsx - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19bEXs9D9Oo4Gwf9dSrTkqVIqc1LpFY1m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101265200977338772115&rtpof=true&sd=true#:~:text=Disciplinary%20Area%20,Area)) ([EE_PS_2425.xlsx - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19bEXs9D9Oo4Gwf9dSrTkqVIqc1LpFY1m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101265200977338772115&rtpof=true&sd=true#:~:text=Required%20Course)).)_
        
- **Senior Thesis or Capstone Project (I)** – The capstone design experience often spans both semesters of senior year. In the first term, students define a project, conduct background research, and begin design and prototyping. At MIT, this could be satisfied by a project-based course (e.g., **6.9000 Engineering for Impact**, a team-based design/build project ([Electrical Engineering with Computing (Course 6-5) | MIT Course Catalog](https://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/electrical-engineering-computing-course-6-5/#:~:text=6,186))). At Stanford, students may enroll in **EE 191** or **EE 191W** for independent research or an honors project, which satisfies the Writing-in-the-Major requirement ([EE 191: Special Studies and Reports in Electrical Engineering](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&q=EE%20191:%20Special%20Studies%20and%20Reports%20in%20Electrical%20Engineering&academicYear=20212022#:~:text=Engineering%20explorecourses.stanford.edu%20%20WIM,major%20requirement)). No textbook is used; instead a faculty advisor guides the project. Deliverables include a proposal and initial progress presentation.
    

**Spring Semester:**

- **Elective (Breadth or General Education):** Many programs allow one or two unrestricted electives or humanities/social science courses in the final semester (to round out the **HASS** requirement at MIT or to complete Stanford’s breadth requirements). EE students often use this slot if needed, or take an additional EE elective if all breadth is done. _(No specific textbook; varies by course chosen.)_
    
- **Professional Ethics and Technology in Society:** Engineering programs often require an ethics or “Technology in Society” course. For example, Stanford requires one **Technology in Society (TiS)** elective ([EE_PS_2425.xlsx - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19bEXs9D9Oo4Gwf9dSrTkqVIqc1LpFY1m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101265200977338772115&rtpof=true&sd=true#:~:text=Technology%20in%20Society%20Requirement%20,for%20list%3B%20See%20note%205)) – topics might include the social impact of technology, engineering ethics, etc., using case studies and readings (no single textbook). MIT integrates ethics into the capstone or a dedicated module.
    
- **Senior Thesis or Capstone Project (II)** – In the final term, the capstone project is completed. Students focus on building, testing, and refining their design, whether it’s a piece of hardware, a software system, or a research experiment. They also finalize a written thesis or project report and present their results in a poster or oral presentation forum. This comprehensive project showcases the skills gained throughout the curriculum – from circuit design to programming to system integration – and is often judged against real-world metrics (performance, cost, reliability, etc.). _Textbook:_ None (students rely on technical literature and datasheets relevant to their specific project).
    
    - _Example:_ A team might design a **wireless sensor network** for environmental monitoring – applying electromagnetics (antenna design), embedded systems (microcontroller programming), analog circuits (sensor interfaces, power management), and signal processing (data filtering) in one project. They would document the entire engineering process, which serves as a culmination of their undergraduate education. (Both MIT and Stanford emphasize these integrative projects; e.g., MIT’s new 6-5 curriculum requires a project-based subject ([Electrical Engineering with Computing (Course 6-5) | MIT Course Catalog](https://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/electrical-engineering-computing-course-6-5/#:~:text=Students%20must%20satisfy%20at%20least,in%20C%20and%20Assembly%206)) ([Electrical Engineering with Computing (Course 6-5) | MIT Course Catalog](https://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/electrical-engineering-computing-course-6-5/#:~:text=6,195)), and Stanford’s honors program centers on a substantial thesis ([Electrical Engineering Program | SoE Undergrad Handbook](https://ughb.stanford.edu/degree-programs/major-programs/electrical-engineering-program#:~:text=EE%20Bachelor%20of%20Science%20with,Honors)) ([Electrical Engineering Program | SoE Undergrad Handbook](https://ughb.stanford.edu/degree-programs/major-programs/electrical-engineering-program#:~:text=Admission%20to%20the%20honors%20program,to%20declare%20honors%20on%20Axess)).)
        
- **(Optional) Engineering Electives or Graduate-level Courses:** Strong students may take graduate electives in their focus area during senior year. For instance, a student interested in digital hardware might take an advanced VLSI design course (using _CMOS VLSI Design_ by Weste & Harris), or one leaning to controls might take Optimal Control (with _Optimal Control Theory_ by Kirk). These deepen knowledge and can often count toward a coterminal MS program.
    

> **Capstone and Integration:** The senior year is characterized by **flexibility and synthesis**. Students tailor their elective choices to their intended career path or graduate study plans. The **capstone project** is a centerpiece: at Stanford, an honors thesis in EE requires formal approval and results in an archived research report ([Electrical Engineering Program | SoE Undergrad Handbook](https://ughb.stanford.edu/degree-programs/major-programs/electrical-engineering-program#:~:text=The%20Electrical%20Engineering%20Department%20offers,graduate%20students%2C%20and%20fellow%20undergraduates)) ([Electrical Engineering Program | SoE Undergrad Handbook](https://ughb.stanford.edu/degree-programs/major-programs/electrical-engineering-program#:~:text=Axess)). At MIT, many students participate in the **SuperUROP** or design project labs to get a similar capstone experience. By the end of Year 4, graduates have a strong foundation in electrical engineering theory, practical lab skills, teamwork experience, and a specialty demonstrated by their elective focus and capstone design.

### Textbook Summary per Key Course:
