# **How to Make (Almost) Anything – Self-Paced Curriculum (MIT 2024)**

This structured syllabus follows MIT’s _How to Make (Almost) Anything_ course, guiding you through digital fabrication, electronics, programming, and project development. Each module below includes key concepts, links to course materials, and hands-on assignments. The progression is designed for self-paced learning – ensure you understand and practice each topic before moving on.

## **Module 1: Principles of Digital Fabrication & Final Project Planning**

Learn the core philosophy of digital fabrication and the scope of the course. This introduction covers the _Principles and Practices_ of modern fabrication technology ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/principles_practices/index.html#:~:text=digital%20fabrication%20,i%27%20for%20index%2C%20videos%20linked)) and outlines your responsibilities in the fab lab (safety, intellectual property, etc.). You will also begin brainstorming your final project from day one. Key topics include an overview of digital fabrication tools ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/principles_practices/index.html#:~:text=digital%20fabrication%20,i%27%20for%20index%2C%20videos%20linked)), class policies, and planning for a semester-long project.

- **Key Concepts:** Understand what digital fabrication entails and how it enables making “almost anything.” Review the **“rights and responsibilities”** for using fabrication facilities (safety procedures, machine use guidelines, etc.). Begin **final project ideation** by sketching and scoping a potential project idea.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Individual Assignment:_ Develop a **plan for a final project**, including a rough sketch or description of what you want to make. This will be a starting point to revisit as you learn new skills in later modules.

## **Module 2: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) & Parametric Modeling**

This module introduces **Computer-Aided Design** for 2D and 3D modeling. You will learn how to create digital models of objects and prepare them for fabrication. The content covers **2D design** (both raster and vector graphics) and **3D design** (solid and surface modeling, parametric and generative design). You will explore a range of CAD tools: from basic drawing programs to professional CAD software. Emphasis is placed on parametric design techniques (using constraints and relationships in your models) and understanding different representation methods (boundary representation, functional representation, etc.). By the end, you’ll be able to design virtual objects and plan how to fabricate them.

- **Topics Covered:** _2D CAD:_ Create and edit raster images and vector drawings using tools like **GIMP** or **Photoshop** for raster, and **Inkscape** or **Adobe Illustrator** for vector graphics. _3D CAD:_ Develop 3D models using tools ranging from **Tinkercad** and **FreeCAD** to professional packages like **Fusion 360** or **SolidWorks** ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_design/index.html#:~:text=AutoCAD%20Inventor%20Fusion%20360%20online,Cinema%204D%20Houdini%20Catia%20Creo)). Understand design principles such as parametric constraints, assemblies, and design history (how complex models are built in steps). Learn about different modeling approaches (sketching, sculpting, algorithmic design) and file formats (e.g., STL, STEP) for transferring designs.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Model a possible final project** in as many forms as you can – create 2D sketches (raster and vector) and 3D CAD designs, and even try renders or simple animations ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_design/index.html#:~:text=assignment)). The goal is to push your CAD skills: for example, model the project’s parts or enclosure and demonstrate key features. **Document your design files** (export images or screenshots) and compress any large media before uploading ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_design/index.html#:~:text=assignment)). This assignment builds your ability to represent an idea digitally in preparation for actual fabrication.

## **Module 3: Project Management & Version Control**

Mastering project management ensures you can document and organize your work throughout the course. In this module, you’ll set up the infrastructure to track your progress. Learn to use **version control systems** (like Git) to manage your files and collaborate, and explore tools for synchronizing and backing up data (for example, command-line tools like `rsync`). You’ll also practice building a personal project website to document your weekly progress. Key principles of time and resource management are introduced: you’ll encounter concepts like the **80/20 rule**, **triage**, and **spiral development** to help prioritize tasks.

- **Topics Covered:** Set up a **Git repository** on the class archive and learn the basics of committing/pushing changes (GitLab and GitHub are used as collaboration platforms). Get familiar with HTML/CSS or static site generators to create your own documentation website. The module also covers strategies for effective project management: distinguishing between demand-vs-supply time management, parallel vs. serial development, and the importance of documenting as you go. Best practices like keeping your work organized in a modular way and reading documentation (“RTFM”) are emphasized.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Sign the agreement forms** (student, instructor, lab use) and set up your personal space in the class repository ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_management/index.html#:~:text=assignment%20assignment%20assignment%20read%2C%20sign,you%20and%20your%20final%20project)). Then, **work through a Git tutorial** (learn to clone, commit, push, and pull). Finally, **create a personal project website** in the class archive. This site should introduce you and outline your final project idea, and you will update it every week with your progress. By completing this, you’ll have a functional version control workflow and an online documentation habit established.

## **Module 4: Computer-Controlled Cutting (Laser & Vinyl Cutting)**

In this hands-on module, you’ll fabricate your first physical pieces using subtractive digital fabrication tools. The focus is on **2D cutting techniques**: using a laser cutter for wood or acrylic sheets, and a vinyl cutter for thin flexible materials. You’ll learn how to prepare design files for cutting and understand machine operation and safety. Key concepts include choosing appropriate materials, adjusting machine settings (like laser power, speed, focus), and accounting for the laser’s kerf (cut width) in your designs. This module also introduces parametric design in practice by making press-fit constructions.

([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/index.html)) _Example of a vinyl-cut sticker created on a computer-controlled cutter. In this module, students learn to produce decals, stencils, and other designs using a vinyl cutter, as well as design laser-cut assemblies._

- **Topics Covered:** Overview of various cutting machines and their uses – from **vinyl cutters** (for decals, flexible circuits, paper crafts) to powerful **laser cutters** for wood, acrylic, etc., and even larger systems like plasma cutters or waterjets for metals. Learn file preparation for cutting: creating vector outlines in software (e.g., Inkscape, CorelDRAW, or Adobe Illustrator) and exporting to machine-ready formats. Practice with **CAM tools** like **mods** or printer drivers to send jobs to the cutters. Understand how to adjust **laser cutter settings**: focus depth, power, speed, number of passes, and how these affect the cut quality. The concept of **kerf** is introduced – you’ll measure the laser’s kerf and adjust your design’s slot sizes for a snug fit. Also, explore creative applications of vinyl cutting (graphics, stickers, masking for etching) and laser cutting (creating 3D forms from 2D parts, engraving patterns).
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ Complete your lab’s **safety training for laser cutting**, then work with classmates to **characterize the laser cutter’s parameters** – test how focus, power, speed, repetition rate, etc., impact different materials. Record the kerf width and optimal settings for cutting without burning or leaving burrs.
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Cut something on the vinyl cutter**, such as a logo or sticker of your choice (this introduces you to designing for a blade cutter). Then **design and laser-cut a parametric construction kit** – a set of interlocking pieces that can be assembled in multiple ways. For example, you might create press-fit puzzle pieces or a small architectural model kit. Document the design (illustrate how you accounted for kerf in slot dimensions) and show multiple assembly configurations. _Bonus:_ include non-flat elements or living hinges in your kit for extra credit.

## **Module 5: Embedded Programming (Microcontrollers Introduction)**

Dive into the world of microcontrollers – the tiny computers that will control your projects. In this module, you’ll learn how microcontrollers are structured and how to program them. We cover basic _computer architecture_ (e.g., **Harvard vs. von Neumann architectures**, RISC vs CISC instruction sets) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/index.html#:~:text=architectures%20von%20Neumann%2C%20Harvard%2C%20bugs,embedded%20FPGA%2C%20TinyFPGA%2C%20IceStorm%2C%20Symbiflow)) to understand how microcontrollers work internally. You will explore microcontroller families (like AVR, ARM, etc.) and their development ecosystems. Key topics include memory types (flash, SRAM, EEPROM) and common _peripherals_ (GPIO ports, analog-to-digital converters, PWM timers, serial communication interfaces). You’ll also get introduced to programming environments and toolchains for embedded C or Arduino and learn to read datasheets to utilize hardware features.

- **Topics Covered:** **Microcontroller fundamentals:** Learn how a basic microcontroller is built – CPU cores, memory hierarchy, and input/output peripherals. Understand the difference between architectures (for example, what distinguishes an 8-bit AVR from a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M). Survey common **microcontroller families** and packages – e.g., the ATtiny series (8-bit AVR chips used in class examples) and ARM microcontrollers ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/index.html#:~:text=ARM%20D11C%2C%20D11D%2C%20D21E%2C%20D51,circuit%20debugging)). Get familiar with **embedded programming tools**: you’ll use compilers (like avr-gcc), programmers (like AVR ISP or JTAG), and possibly Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for higher-level support. Practice writing simple programs in C or Arduino (like blinking an LED or reading a button) and learn how to upload code to your board. You will also simulate or emulate code when possible to verify logic. Crucially, learn to navigate a **microcontroller datasheet** to find pin functions, electrical limits, and programming details.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ With your labmates, **set up and compare different toolchains** for programming microcontrollers. For instance, one person might use the Arduino IDE, another uses the command-line `gcc` and `avrdude`, and another tries a platform like MicroPython. As a group, demonstrate each workflow and note the pros/cons of these development environments (e.g., ease of use vs. level of control).
    - _Individual Assignment:_ Choose a specific microcontroller (likely the one on a provided development board or your custom board) and **write a program for it**. A typical task could be reading a sensor value and blinking an LED based on the input. First, **read through the microcontroller’s datasheet** to understand its capabilities. Then write and debug the program in C (or Arduino language) and **simulate its operation** if possible (for example, use a simulator or the serial output to verify logic). Finally, if you have the hardware ready, **load the program onto a microcontroller board and test it** to interact with input/output devices (button presses, sensor readings, LED or serial output). _Extra credit:_ Try the same logic in multiple languages (e.g., in assembly or using CircuitPython) or on different microcontroller models to broaden your exposure.

## **Module 6: 3D Scanning and Printing**

This module explores **additive manufacturing** and 3D digitization. You will learn how 3D printers work and how to design objects for successful printing, as well as how to create 3D scans of real-world objects. Key printing concepts include the difference between **subtractive vs. additive processes**, the limitations of 3D printing (such as resolution, support requirements, material properties), and various 3D printing technologies (FDM, SLA, etc.). The module also covers **design rules for 3D printing** – for example, understanding overhang angles, minimum feature size, wall thickness, and anisotropy (directional strength) in printed parts. On the scanning side, you will learn techniques to capture real objects as digital 3D models, using methods like photogrammetry or structured light scanning.

([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/index.html)) _Design rule test pieces for 3D printing – the white model on the left was printed with support material for the overhanging bridge, while the one on the right demonstrates the limits of overhang angle without support. In this module, students characterize such constraints to optimize their designs for additive manufacturing._

- **Topics Covered:** **3D Printing:** Understand the workflow from CAD model to printed object. Learn about common printer types – for example, **Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)** printers that extrude plastic filament layer by layer, and alternatives like **Stereolithography (SLA)** resin printers or powder bed systems. Discuss printer **constraints and settings**: why certain overhangs require support structures, how layer thickness affects resolution and print time, and how infill density and pattern influence strength and material usage. Explore different **materials** used in 3D printing: PLA and ABS plastics (and their properties like glass transition temperature and strength), flexible TPU, composites with wood or metal fill, etc., including issues like moisture sensitivity of filaments. Examine **design guidelines** (often by printing test artifacts): e.g., what is the smallest hole or thinnest wall your printer can reliably produce, how to orient parts to minimize warping, and techniques like adding brims or rafts to improve bed adhesion. **3D Scanning:** Learn the principles of turning a physical object into a digital model. This includes understanding **point clouds and meshes**, and the importance of lighting and surface texture when scanning. Practice with a 3D scanning method available to you – for instance, using a structured-light scanner, a laser scanner, or even a smartphone photogrammetry app. You’ll see concepts like ensuring a watertight mesh and cleaning up scans.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ **Test the design rules of your 3D printer(s)**. As a group, print calibration objects (e.g., an overhang test, a bridging test, a dimensional accuracy test) on the available printers. Measure the outcomes: what is the steepest overhang that can print without support, the smallest feature that comes out well, the clearance needed for moving parts, etc.. Compile these findings into a reference so everyone knows the capabilities and limits of each machine.
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Design and 3D print an object that could not be easily made subtractively**. This means creating a shape that would be very difficult to mill or cut from a solid block – for example, a complex internal geometry, a flexible chain or ball-in-cage printed in one piece, or an organic form. Use the design guidelines you learned to ensure it prints successfully within a few cubic centimeters of material (to fit the print time constraints). After printing, evaluate the result against your design (did all details come out?). Additionally, **3D scan an object** of your choice. You can scan an artifact or one of your own prints. Clean up the scanned model and, if you like, try to **re-print the scanned object** to complete the loop from physical to digital back to physical. Document both the scanning process and the printed design with photos and notes on challenges and improvements.

## **Module 7: Electronics Design (PCB Design and EDA Tools)**

Now that you have learned to program microcontrollers, it’s time to design the hardware for them. This module covers **Electronics Design**, focusing on designing a custom PCB (Printed Circuit Board) that includes a microcontroller and other components. You will learn the basics of electronic components and circuit theory relevant to digital circuits. We cover common components (resistors, capacitors, LEDs, transistors, etc.) and their behavior (Ohm’s law for resistors, I/V curves for diodes, etc.), as well as how to select and connect them in a circuit. The use of **EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software** is a major part – you’ll learn to capture a schematic and then layout a PCB for fabrication. Important concepts include schematic design, component footprints, PCB layers, routing traces, and design rules (like clearance and trace width). By the end, you’ll have designed a small microcontroller board ready for production.

- **Topics Covered:** **Electronic Components:** Identify and understand key components – e.g., resistors (with their value notations and using Ohm’s law), capacitors (understand capacitance and the difference between polarized vs. unpolarized types), oscillators (crystals vs. resonators), diodes (rectifier vs. Zener vs. LEDs and their forward voltage behavior), transistors (bipolar vs. MOSFET and how they can switch or amplify), voltage regulators for powering your circuit, and of course microcontrollers and their support circuits (clock sources, pull-up resistors, etc.). **Circuit Design Principles:** Learn how to draw a circuit schematic – placing symbols and wiring connections. Understand **Kirchhoff’s laws** and basic circuit analysis to verify your design (e.g., that supply voltages and ground are properly distributed). Consider decoupling capacitors and other practices for stable circuits. **PCB Layout:** Transition from schematic to board layout. You’ll use an EDA tool of your choice (such as **KiCad**, **Eagle**, or others) to position components and route copper traces on a PCB. Learn about copper layers, routing angles (why 45° traces are common), vias for two-sided boards, and how to adhere to **design rules** – ensuring traces are not too close and drill holes are sized correctly for the fabrication process. The module also touches on using autorouters vs. manual routing and exporting the design files (Gerbers) for manufacturing.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ Use the **test equipment in your lab to observe an electronics circuit in action**. This could involve using an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to look at the signals on an existing demo board or kit. The goal is to familiarize yourselves with tools like multimeters, oscilloscopes, and power supplies. For example, measure the voltage levels and waveforms on a simple microcontroller board (check the clock signal or a blinking LED’s voltage). Discuss as a group what the readings mean (e.g., verify that a 5V regulator is outputting 5V, or that a button press changes a pin from high to low).
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Design a microcontroller development board** (PCB) using an EDA tool. This board should include a microcontroller and necessary components (power regulation, a programming header, I/O connections like an LED or button, etc.) using only parts available in the course **inventory**. Follow good design practices and run ERC/DRC checks (Electrical/Design Rule Checks) to ensure the board is error-free. Once designed, export your board layout for production. _Extra credit:_ Simulate part of your circuit (using a SPICE simulator or the EDA’s simulator) to verify its behavior, or try designing the board using an alternate workflow (for instance, design the schematic in one tool and PCB in another). You might also create a simple 3D-printed or laser-cut **enclosure** for your board as an additional design exercise (optional but encouraged for practice).

## **Module 8: Electronics Production (PCB Fabrication)**

In this module, you will fabricate the circuit board you designed. The class provides two primary ways to make PCBs: **in-house PCB fabrication** (typically by milling copper boards on a CNC or using other rapid prototyping techniques), and outsourcing to a **PCB fabrication house**. You’ll learn the process of PCB production, including preparing files for milling or etching and understanding the limitations of each process (such as minimum trace width and spacing – the design rules you must follow). We also cover methods to assemble and test the board once it’s made (soldering components and debugging). Safety and proper handling of tools and chemicals are emphasized when making PCBs.

- **Topics Covered:** **PCB Fabrication Methods:** Learn how to mill a PCB on a small CNC machine by carving away copper. This involves choosing the right end mills (for example, a 1/64" flat end mill for fine traces) and understanding milling settings (spindle speed, feed rate, depth per pass) to achieve the desired trace width. Alternatively, explore **chemical etching** techniques (using reagents like ferric chloride or persulfate to etch copper) and how to safely handle and dispose of these chemicals. Understand terms like _feature size_ (the smallest copper trace or gap your process can resolve). The module also introduces specialized processes: using **vinyl cutters** for flexible circuits, or even low-cost PCB printers with conductive inks. **Materials:** Learn about PCB substrate materials – FR-4 fiberglass vs. FR-1 paper phenolic (which is easier to mill), as well as flexible materials like Kapton for flexible PCBs. Understand copper cladding thickness (e.g., 1 oz copper vs 2 oz) and how it affects milling and current carrying capacity ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_production/index.html#:~:text=glass%20copper%200,0%20oz%3A%2070%20um)). **PCB Assembly:** Once the board is fabricated, practice soldering components onto it. Identify orientation for LEDs, microcontrollers, and other polarized parts. Use tools like multimeters to check for shorts or continuity. **PCB Testing & Debugging:** Basic debugging strategies are covered (visually inspecting solder joints, using a microscope, verifying component placement and orientation, measuring voltages at key points) to ensure your board works as intended.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ **Characterize your in-house PCB production process and design rules**. As a group, determine the capabilities of your PCB mill or etching setup. For example, mill a test pattern of various trace widths and spacings to find the minimum size that comes out reliably ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_production/index.html#:~:text=assignment%20assignment%20assignment%20group%20assignment%3A,house%20PCB%20production)). Document the drill sizes, the cut accuracy, and any quirks of your machine (like slight offsets or alignment issues). Also, practice sending out a board file to a commercial **board house** (such as JLCPCB or PCBWay) – even if you don’t order it, go through the quoting process to see how to prepare production files.
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Fabricate and assemble the microcontroller board you designed** ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_production/index.html#:~:text=group%20assignment%3A%20,house%20PCB%20production)). If using the PCB mill, generate the toolpaths for your board (for traces, holes, and outline) and mill it out. If a process fails (e.g., a trace lifts or breaks), refine the settings or design and try again. After you have a board, solder all components in place and **test the board** to verify it functions – for example, program the microcontroller with a simple blink program to ensure the connections are correct. Document the production steps, any challenges (like if you had to troubleshoot a shorted trace), and the final working board. _Extra credit:_ Fabricate the board using an alternative method – for instance, if you milled it first, try making another copy by chemical etching, or vice versa. This will give you perspective on the strengths of each PCB fabrication approach.

## **Module 9: Molding and Casting**

Learn how to make objects by creating molds and casting materials into them. This module introduces **molding and casting processes** for plastics, rubbers, and other materials. You will design a 3D mold (often by machining a positive or negative form) and then use it to cast parts in various materials. The content covers different mold types – such as **injection molding** (and small-scale DIY versions of it), **silicone molding** (flexible molds for complex shapes), and **casting metal** (using low-melt alloys or foundry techniques). We also discuss mold design considerations: draft angles, parting lines, venting, and avoiding undercuts for rigid molds. Material science is a big component: you’ll handle materials like silicones, urethanes, plasters, and even edible materials, learning their properties (work time, curing time, shrinkage, strength, etc.) and safe usage (reviewing Safety Data Sheets). By the end, you’ll produce a cast part of your own design.

- **Topics Covered:** **Mold Design:** Understand the geometry of molds – when to use a one-part vs. two-part mold, how to include alignment features, and how to ensure you can release the cast part. Explore different **molding techniques**: for example, designing a mold for **injection molding** (sprues, runners, gates, vents, etc.) on a small scale, **vacuum forming** thermoplastics over a shape, **silicone molding** for complex or undercut shapes, and **casting with flexible molds** so the part can be extracted even if it has complicated geometry. **Materials for Casting:** Get to know a variety of casting materials. **Plastics and Rubbers:** Work with _silicone rubber_ and _urethane_ resins that can capture fine detail (mixing and degassing these, using mold release agents). Try casting with **epoxy** or **urethane plastics** for rigid parts, possibly with color pigments. Experiment with **plaster or concrete** for artistic or architectural objects (like molding gypsum or cement). **Metals:** Understand low-temperature metal casting (like using _Field’s metal_ or _Cerrotru_ alloys that melt in hot water) and the basics of sand casting aluminum (for advanced exploration). There’s even room for **edible casting** (e.g., making chocolate or gelatin gummies in a mold) and **biomaterials** for the adventurous. Throughout, emphasize _safety_: many resins require gloves, proper ventilation, and careful mixing as noted in their SDS (Safety Data Sheets).
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ **Review the Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for all molding and casting materials you plan to use**. As a group, gather the SDS for your silicone, resin, foam, etc., and ensure everyone understands the hazards (for example, some epoxies are skin irritants, plasters can get hot as they cure, etc.). Then **make test casts** with each material to observe their behavior. For instance, mix a small amount of silicone, pour it and see how long it takes to cure and how flexible the result is, versus a urethane which might be more rigid. Also, if multiple molding processes are available (3D printed molds, machined molds, etc.), compare those – perhaps cast the same shape in a silicone mold vs. a 3D printed mold and note differences.
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Design a mold for an object and cast parts from it**. Using CAD, design the mold (this could be a two-part mold for a 3D object or a single-part mold for something like a medallion). Ensure your design considers draft angles and that the milling tool can reach all areas if you’re machining it. Next, **fabricate the mold** – common approach is to mill wax blocks to create a negative mold, or 3D print the mold if suitable. Once your mold is ready, use it to **cast a part** in your chosen material (for example, cast a soft silicone toy, or a hard plastic gear). Aim for a smooth surface finish on the mold so the cast comes out smooth (you shouldn’t see machining toolpaths on the cast part). Document the process and show the final cast results. _Extra credit:_ Use more than two mold parts or a multi-step molding (for instance, over-mold one material over another) to create more complex objects.

## **Module 10: Input Devices (Sensors and Measurement)**

Having a programmable board is only useful if it can sense the world. In this module, you will add **input devices** to your electronics – sensors that allow your projects to measure environmental or user data. You’ll explore different types of sensors (digital and analog) and how to integrate them with microcontrollers. Topics include simple digital inputs like switches and buttons (with debouncing), **analog sensors** such as potentiometers, temperature sensors, microphones, or light sensors, and more complex modules for measuring things like motion or bio-signals. You will learn about reading analog values using ADC (Analog-to-Digital Conversion) and communicating with smart sensors over protocols like I²C. The module also covers how to condition sensor signals (using resistive voltage dividers, pull-up resistors, or op-amp circuits) and how to interpret sensor data in software.

- **Topics Covered:** **Switches and Digital Inputs:** Start with the basics – wiring up a simple **button** and reading its state in your microcontroller program. Implement debouncing either in hardware or software to get stable readings. **Analog Sensors:** Learn to use potentiometers (variable resistors) for position sensing or as simple user inputs (knobs). Use the microcontroller’s ADC to read voltages from sensors like a temperature thermistor or a light-dependent resistor (LDR). Understand concepts of analog ranges, resolution (e.g., 10-bit ADC gives values 0–1023), and noise. **Complex Sensors:** Explore modules for measuring different phenomena – for example, a **Hall effect sensor** for magnetic fields, accelerometers/gyros for motion, distance sensors (ultrasonic or IR), etc. You’ll see how some sensors output analog voltages, while others might use digital communication (I²C temperature sensors, serial GPS modules, etc.). The content introduces protocols like I²C and SPI in context, so you know how to retrieve data from sensor modules. **Techniques:** Learn about using **pull-up resistors** for buttons, proper wiring to avoid noise, and shielding for sensitive analog measurements. Also, see how to use filtering (either a simple RC filter or digital averaging) to smooth sensor readings. By the end, you should be able to interface at least one new sensor with a microcontroller and get meaningful data.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ **Probe an input device’s signals with lab equipment** ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/input_devices/index.html#:~:text=assignment%20group%20assignment%3A%20probe%20an,have%20designed%20and%20read%20it)). As a group, connect a sensor (for example, a phototransistor or flex sensor) to a microcontroller and use an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to observe the output. If it’s analog, observe the voltage levels changing in response to input (like varying light or bending). If digital (like a serial data stream from a sensor), use the tools to capture the waveform. The goal is to correlate what the sensor is doing with the electrical signals and ensure you can properly read them with a microcontroller ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/input_devices/index.html#:~:text=assignment%20group%20assignment%3A%20probe%20an,have%20designed%20and%20read%20it)).
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Measure something by building a sensor-integrated board** ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/input_devices/index.html#:~:text=probe%20an%20input%20device%27s%20analog,have%20designed%20and%20read%20it)). Take the development board you made (or design a small new board) and add a sensor to it. This might involve designing and milling a new PCB that includes, say, a light sensor or a temperature sensor connected to your microcontroller, or simply wiring a sensor to your existing board if it has the I/O. Write a program to read the sensor data and perhaps output it (for example, send the readings over serial or display them by blinking an LED in patterns). For instance, you could measure temperature and have an LED blink faster as it gets warmer. **Document your readings** and calibrate or interpret the sensor values (e.g., convert a raw ADC value to actual units like degrees or voltage). This exercise demonstrates the full loop of adding a new input device: from hardware design/modification to software reading and interpreting the data.

## **Module 11: Output Devices (Actuators and Displays)**

In this module, you will complement your input skills by learning about **output devices** – components that allow your microcontroller to affect the world. Outputs can range from simple LEDs and buzzers to motors and displays. You will learn how to drive these devices properly (including necessary driver circuits or power considerations) and program them to perform tasks. Key topics include understanding power requirements and limitations (for example, how much current an LED or motor draws and the need for transistors or drivers), using Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) to control things like LED brightness or motor speed, and ensuring safety with outputs (protecting against back-EMF from motors, not exceeding voltage limits, etc.). By the end, you’ll be able to add an output device to your board and have it do something interesting (move, light up, make sound, etc.).

- **Topics Covered:** **LEDs and Indicators:** Start with controlling an LED (light-emitting diode). Learn about current-limiting resistors and how to choose a suitable resistor value for an LED. Use PWM from the microcontroller to fade an LED (dimming control). Explore **Charlieplexing** to drive multiple LEDs with fewer pins by taking advantage of tri-state logic ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/output_devices/index.html#:~:text=PWM%20%20%2031%20video,51%20makefile%20%20%2053)). Move to **RGB LEDs and addressable LED strips** (like NeoPixels), understanding how to send data to them and power them. **Motors and Actuators:** Learn about different kinds of motors – DC motors, servos, stepper motors – and what is needed to drive them. For example, small DC motors might require a transistor or MOSFET as a switch and a diode for flyback protection (to handle the voltage spike when the motor is turned off). For stepper motors or larger loads, understand the use of motor driver ICs or H-bridges. You’ll also discuss power supplies for motors (since they often need more current than a microcontroller pin can supply) and the concept of separate power domains (with common ground). Other outputs can include **speakers/buzzers** (using PWM or DAC for sound), **displays** (small LCD/OLED screens via I²C or SPI), and even exotic actuators like **shape-memory alloys or muscle wire** and **pneumatic or hydraulic actuators** in advanced cases. Across these, focus on interfacing: e.g., how to generate the correct signals for a servo (a specific PWM pulse width), or how to shift voltage levels for an addressable LED strip if needed. Also, pay attention to **electrical safety** and not drawing too much current from your microcontroller (use external power transistors or modules as needed).
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ **Measure the power consumption of an output device**. As a group, pick an output component (for example, a small DC motor or a strip of LEDs) and use a multimeter or power monitor to measure how much current it draws under various conditions. This is to practice quantifying the power needs and to ensure your designs can meet those needs. For instance, measure an LED at different brightness levels or a motor under no load vs. loaded conditions. Share results and determine if the microcontroller alone can drive it or if you need a driver circuit.
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Add an output device to a microcontroller board you designed and program it** to do something useful or interesting. You could add a small buzzer and make it play notes, or attach a motor and make it spin, or connect an LCD to display a message. This may involve designing a new board or modifying your existing one to include the necessary driver components. Write the code to control the output (for example, spin a motor one direction, then the other, or display sensor readings on an LCD). Ensure you include any required safety components (diodes for motors, resistors for LEDs) in your design. Document the outcome: e.g., a video of an LED light show or a motor-driven mechanism moving as programmed.

## **Module 12: Computer-Controlled Machining (CNC Cutting of Large Formats)**

Take a step into **big CNC machines** for fabricating large objects. In this module, you will use a **CNC router** (such as a ShopBot or other large-format milling machine) to create something sizable (on the order of a meter scale). You’ll learn about machining materials like plywood, MDF, and plastics, and how to create toolpaths for cutting, pocketing, and drilling. Key concepts include **feeds and speeds** (the proper spindle RPM and feed rate for a given tool and material), tool selection (end mills of various diameters, flute counts, and profiles) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_machining/index.html#:~:text=tooling%20drills%20vs%20mills%20router%2C,straight%20cut%20flat%2Fball%20end%20tapered)), and workholding/fixturing techniques to secure your material. This module also heavily emphasizes **safety** – these machines are powerful, and you must follow strict safety protocols (such as using eye and ear protection, not leaving the machine unattended, etc.). By the end of the module, you’ll have made a piece of furniture or another “big” project component.

- **Topics Covered:** **CNC Router Basics:** Understand the parts of a CNC machine – the spindle, collets, end mills, and the coordinate system. Learn how to plan a job: setting the origin, safe travel heights, and tool changes if necessary. **Materials and Stock:** Explore materials commonly used: plywood and MDF (wood composites) are staple materials – know their thickness, how they behave when cut (splintering, need for tabs, etc.), and how to finish them. Other options include solid wood, foam insulation boards for prototypes, or even aluminum sheets for more advanced work. **Tooling and CAM:** Select appropriate cutting tools – e.g., a 1/4" flat end mill for general cutting, a smaller bit for detailed features, or a ball-end mill for 3D contours. Learn about tool properties like number of flutes and up-cut vs. down-cut bits (up-cut bits remove chips well but can tear out material on the top surface, down-cut do the opposite) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_machining/index.html#:~:text=drills%20vs%20mills%20router%2C%20V,flat%2Fball%20end%20tapered%20extra%20long)). Calculate **feeds and speeds**: use guidelines or chip load charts to choose a router bit RPM and feed rate that yields a good cut without burning or overloading the tool. Set up a CAM software (like Fusion 360 CAM, VCarve, or ShopBot’s software) to generate toolpaths, including profiling cuts (cutting all the way through) and pocketing (clearing out an area to a certain depth). Add **tabs** to keep cut pieces from moving, and consider **dogbone fillets** for interior corners if you need square fits. **Safety and Machine Operation:** Always do a safety check – secure the material (screw it down or use clamps in non-cut areas) and do a dry run if possible. Be aware of emergency stop procedures. Listen to the machine – a high-pitched squeal means feed rate may be too high, etc. After cutting, learn to clean up edges (sanding, filing) and assemble the pieces.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ **Complete safety training for the CNC machine and test its accuracy**. Together, verify the machine’s setup: check the spindle runout (does the bit wobble or is it true?), the bed alignment, etc.. Each team member should understand how to home the machine, change a tool, and pause/stop the job in an emergency. Run a small test pattern on scrap material that includes straight cuts, curves, and perhaps a pocket, to ensure the machine is calibrated and cutting as expected (measure the cut dimensions to see if they match the design).
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Design, mill, and assemble a large-format object (around meter-scale)**. This could be a piece of furniture (chair, table, shelf), a structural component of your final project, or any creative large assembly. Use CAD to design your parts, paying attention to material thickness and how pieces will slot together or be fastened (consider using press-fit joints, screws, etc.). Generate CNC toolpaths and mill the parts out. Aim to **avoid using traditional fasteners or glue** by employing clever joint designs (like finger joints, slots, wedges) – this is for the challenge of using digital fabrication for joinery. If your design does require screws or glue, that’s okay, but attempt the extra credit of no fasteners if you can. Also, try to incorporate a **curved surface or 3D element** if possible (this could mean using a ball-end bit to surface a curved shape or bending cut pieces). Assemble your final object and document the process and the outcome (does it support weight, function as intended, etc.).

## **Module 13: Mechanical Design (Machine Building, Part 1)**

Over the next two modules, the class will collaborate to design and build a complete machine. In **Mechanical Design**, your team will focus on the frame, mechanics, and motion components of a machine, without yet fully automating it. This is a group project module where the entire class (or sub-teams) **design a machine that includes mechanism, actuation, and an intended application**. You’ll learn about mechanical engineering concepts such as degrees of freedom, linkages, transmission of motion, and structural design. Components like gears, pulleys, belts, screws, and bearings are introduced, and you will use them in your machine design. The outcome of this week is the mechanical assembly of the machine – essentially the “body” of a device – which will be brought to life with electronics and programming in the next module.

- **Topics Covered:** **Mechanical Components:** Explore a variety of mechanical parts that can be used to build machines. This includes **fasteners** (screws, nuts, bolts, inserts) for joining parts, **gears and pulleys** for transmitting motion (e.g., spur gears, timing belts, rack and pinion), and **linear motion components** (like rods, slides, bearings) for guiding movement. Learn about different types of **bearings** (ball bearings for rotary shafts, linear bearings for moving along a rail) and why they’re important for reducing friction. **Mechanism Design:** Understand mechanical principles such as **stress and strain** (ensuring your machine parts can handle forces without bending or breaking), **backlash** in gears and how to minimize it, and **kinematic couplings** for precise alignment. Study example mechanisms (a scissor lift, a four-bar linkage, a gear train) to inspire your own machine’s design. **Collaboration Tools:** As this is a team effort, you’ll use version control or shared CAD (for example, building the machine assembly in a common CAD project) to coordinate. Define interfaces between subsystems so different people can work on different parts (for instance, one team designs a chassis, another designs an XY motion stage to mount on that chassis). The goal is to finalize a design that can be fabricated using the tools at hand (laser cutting, CNC machining, 3D printing, etc., as appropriate for each part). Fabrication then takes place: everyone manufactures the parts they are responsible for and helps in assembly. By the end, you should have the **mechanical structure of a machine assembled** – it might be something like a drawing robot, a mini CNC, an art display, etc., but at this stage, you can move it manually to see that the mechanical design works.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ As a class or in sub-teams, **design a machine including its mechanism, actuation, and overall structure**. This means collectively deciding on a machine to make – for example, a machine that can draw on a whiteboard, or a small-scale conveyor sorting system, or anything creative that involves moving parts. Break down the design into components: frame, motion axes, end effector, etc. Use the skills from prior modules to fabricate the **mechanical parts** of the machine and assemble them. At this stage, you should be able to operate it **manually** (for instance, turn a lead screw by hand to see an axis move). Document each person’s contributions and how the parts integrate. Essentially, you are creating the prototype of the machine without its “brains” fully implemented yet. Make sure to capture what problems you encountered and how you resolved alignment or assembly issues. (Note: Documentation should clearly distinguish each student’s individual contribution to the group project.)

## **Module 14: Machine Design (Automation & Integration, Part 2)**

Continuing from the previous module, this week you will **actuate and automate the machine** you built. This involves integrating electronics (motor drivers, sensors, controllers) and writing software to control the machine’s movements. You will learn about **motion control** concepts like open-loop vs. closed-loop control, and implement some form of control (it might be as simple as timed moves, or as complex as using feedback from sensors). The module covers how to interface multiple motors and coordinate their action (for example, controlling two stepper motors to move an XY gantry). You’ll also address networking the machine’s modules if needed (for instance, if using multiple microcontrollers). By the end, the class project machine should be operational, performing its intended task under computer control.

- **Topics Covered:** **Actuators & Drivers for Machines:** Choose appropriate actuation for each degree of freedom in your machine – often **stepper motors** for precise positional control, or DC motors/servos for continuous or feedback-based motion. Learn how to drive these: e.g., using stepper drivers or motor shields, and understand stepping modes (full, half, micro-stepping). **Sensor Integration:** If your machine needs end-stop switches or sensors for calibration (to know home positions, etc.), integrate those. Understand the concept of **closed-loop control** – using sensors (like encoders on motors or limit switches) to inform the controller of the machine’s state. **Networking & Communication:** If multiple boards are used (say one board per motor axis), set up a communication bus (could be serial or I²C, etc.) to coordinate them. Alternatively, use one microcontroller to control everything if it has enough I/O. **Control Software:** Develop the software to run the machine. This could involve using or writing a simple G-code interpreter or just hardcoding sequences of motion. Learn about motion planning – how to accelerate and decelerate smoothly (avoiding skipping steps on steppers), how to handle concurrency of motion if multiple axes move together. Basic **control theory** is introduced (PID controllers for closed-loop control, for instance) though a simple project might not require full PID tuning. Also consider the user interface or how you will command the machine – maybe a serial command set or a simple GUI.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ **Actuate and automate your machine**, getting it to perform its intended function. Divide tasks among team members: some work on wiring and electronics integration (mounting boards, routing wires safely on the machine), others work on programming the control software. Ensure that each axis or component of the machine can be controlled via code (e.g., send a command to step the motor and it moves as expected). Then create a coordinated program or script to make the machine do something useful – for instance, if it’s a drawing machine, make it draw a test pattern. **Debug as a team**: you might need to adjust motor currents, fix mechanical binding, or refine code for better accuracy. Finally, document the finished machine, including a description of the mechanism, the electronics, the software, and each member’s contribution to reaching a functional automated system. This documentation serves as the culmination of the group project.

## **Module 15: Networking and Communications**

Individual projects often involve multiple microcontrollers or communicating with external devices. In this module, you’ll learn how to make your devices talk to each other or to a computer. We explore both **wired and wireless communications**. On the wired side, you’ll implement protocols such as asynchronous serial (UART) to connect at least two boards (for example, a master and a node device) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/networking_communications/index.html#:~:text=wired%20UART%2C%20USART%2C%20SERCOM%2C%20PIO%2C,6%20traces%20%20%208)). You’ll also learn about more complex bus protocols like **I²C** and **SPI** for communication between chips (sensors, displays, etc.). On the wireless side, common options include Bluetooth, WiFi, or radio modules (e.g., Zigbee or LoRa). Key concepts include addressing schemes, data framing (how to structure messages), and error checking. By networking devices, you can have one board send sensor data to another, or have a central controller coordinate multiple units.

- **Topics Covered:** **Wired Networking:** Start with basic serial communication – use UART to send messages between two boards using an FTDI cable or a direct connection. Understand the timing (baud rates) and how to frame data (start bits, stop bits). Learn about multi-drop serial networks (such as using RS-485 transceivers for robust long-distance communication) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/networking_communications/index.html#:~:text=wired%20UART%2C%20USART%2C%20SERCOM%2C%20PIO%2C,6%20traces%20%20%208)). Implement a simple protocol where one board is a _bridge_ and others are _nodes_ on a serial bus, each with an address. For example, you might set up a network of tiny boards that each control an LED, receiving commands from a master board. Explore **I²C (Two-Wire Interface)**: learn how a microcontroller can act as an I²C master to talk to peripheral chips (like temperature sensors or LCD drivers). Also recognize SPI, which is a faster 4-wire protocol useful for certain peripherals (SD card modules, etc.). **Wireless Communication:** Look at options for wireless links – for instance, using a **Bluetooth module** to send data to a phone, or a **WiFi module** (like ESP8266/ESP32) to post data online. Low-power radios like LoRa can send data over long distances with simple packets (with lower bandwidth). Learn how to configure these modules and the libraries/protocols (e.g., using AT commands for Bluetooth or network stacks for WiFi). **Networking Concepts:** Learn common paradigms like addressing (each node needs an ID), message types, and perhaps the basics of network topology (star, bus, mesh). Consider error handling – checksums or acknowledgments to confirm message receipt. By the end, you should be comfortable connecting at least two devices in a network and exchanging information.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ **Send a message between two projects**. As a group, demonstrate a network communication where data produced in one person’s project is sent to another’s. For instance, one student’s board with a sensor could send a reading to another student’s board that displays it or reacts to it. This can be wired or wireless. The key is to ensure interoperability – possibly decide on a common communication protocol or format as a group. Document the process: how you defined the message (e.g., “Board A sends a temperature reading as a string, Board B receives and blinks an LED if above a threshold”). This group task ties your individual projects together in a simple network.
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Design and build a networked device or add networking to your board**. If you have multiple boards from previous assignments, connect them. For example, you might have a sensor board and an output board – now make them communicate: the sensor board sends data, the output board takes action. Alternatively, you can create a new setup: design a pair of small boards (or use a single board with wireless capability) that communicate with each other or with a computer. Each board should have a network address or identifier, and you should implement a minimal protocol (even as simple as sending bytes or text strings). Show that you can reliably send and receive messages. This will prepare you for integrating networking into your final project if needed (such as communicating with a phone or linking multiple subsystems together).

## **Module 16: Interface and Application Programming**

Now that you have devices gathering data and performing actions, you’ll learn how to create a user interface or application to control or monitor them. This module is about **higher-level programming** – writing software that runs on a PC, smartphone, or web browser that interacts with your hardware. You will explore a variety of programming languages and environments for interface development. Options range from graphical environments like Processing, P5.js (JavaScript), or MIT App Inventor, to conventional GUI toolkits (Python with Tkinter/PyQt, web interfaces with HTML/JS/CSS) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/interface_application_programming/index.html#:~:text=Processing%2C%20Wiring%2C%20Arduino%2C%20p5,js%2C%20WebAssembly%2C%20CoffeeScript%2C%20TypeScript%2C%20DeviceScript)). You might also consider mobile apps or even game engines as interface platforms. The key skills are designing a user-friendly way to present data from your device or send commands to it, and establishing the communication between the software and your hardware (via serial, Bluetooth, network, etc.). This module also touches on concepts of usability and human-computer interaction when designing your interface.

- **Topics Covered:** **Programming Languages and Tools:** Gain exposure to many languages – C/C++ for performance, Python for quick development (e.g., using libraries like PySerial to talk to devices), JavaScript for web interfaces, etc. The course material provides examples from a “hello world” in many languages to illustrate the breadth, as well as links to creative coding frameworks like **Processing** and **p5.js** for graphics and interaction ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/interface_application_programming/index.html#:~:text=Processing%2C%20Wiring%2C%20Arduino%2C%20p5,js%2C%20WebAssembly%2C%20CoffeeScript%2C%20TypeScript%2C%20DeviceScript)). **Graphical User Interfaces (GUI):** Learn how to create a simple GUI that might include buttons, sliders, or graphs to control/visualize your device. For instance, you could use **Python with Tkinter** to make a window with a button that sends a command over serial, or use **JavaScript** in a web page to send data via WebUSB/WebSerial to your board. **Data Visualization:** If your project generates data, explore ways to display it – maybe plotting sensor readings over time or creating visual indicators. **Low-code options:** The module also shows graphical programming and dataflow environments like **Node-RED** or **LabVIEW** where you can build logic by connecting blocks, which can be useful if you prefer a visual approach. **Web and Mobile Interfaces:** Consider making a web dashboard or a simple mobile app (the course mentions App Inventor and others). If using a web interface, you might use WebSockets or HTTP requests to communicate with a device (for example, an ESP32 running a web server). **Interface Design Principles:** While not a full HCI course, basic principles like responsiveness, clarity, and user feedback are discussed. Security might also be touched on (for example, not exposing an interface to the internet without safeguards, and understanding open ports). By the end, you should be able to pick a suitable environment and create a basic application that talks to your project.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Group Assignment:_ **Compare as many interface/tool options as possible**. Split the group to try different frameworks for interface programming. For example, one person makes a quick Processing sketch to visualize data, another creates a small webpage with p5.js, another writes a Python script for a GUI, etc. As a group, gather insights: which platform was easiest to get running? Which provided the best performance or flexibility? Share simple examples from each (like a “press button to turn LED on” app in multiple forms). This will give everyone a taste of different tools and help inform what to use in final projects.
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Write an application that interfaces with a device you made**. Choose the interface style that suits you (web, desktop, or mobile) and implement a program where a user can input or trigger something and your hardware responds, or vice versa. For instance, you might create a GUI to adjust the threshold on a sensor and display the sensor’s value, or a game-like interface where your board is a controller. Ensure you cover both directions if applicable: _input from user to device_ (e.g., a button in the app sends a command to the board) and/or _data from device to user_ (e.g., sensor values shown on screen). This will likely involve programming with serial communication or network sockets. Document the interface with screenshots and explain how the data flows. This exercise ties together your hardware and software skills, enabling richer interactions with your project.

## **Module 17: Wildcard Week (Advanced Digital Fabrication Option)**

This week allows you to explore a **digital fabrication technique not covered in the standard modules**. It’s a chance to delve into something novel or specialized based on your interests or project needs. You will pick one topic or process (examples include composites, biotechnology-related fabrication, textile manufacturing, multi-axis machining, etc.) and learn how to design and create something using that process. The idea is to incorporate computer-aided design and manufacturing in a new context, demonstrating your ability to apply your skills to a broader range of making. The course provides numerous possibilities, such as **5-axis CNC machining, waterjet cutting, welding, robotics (like making a robotic arm or soft robotic actuator), advanced electronics (like using a pick-and-place machine or FPGA programming), textile crafts (digital embroidery or wearable electronics), and even bio-fabrication**. Since not everyone will choose the same topic, you’ll get to see a variety of student explorations.

- **Topics Covered:** This module is open-ended. Some illustrative examples: **Composites:** Learn to work with fiber composites – design a shape and create it by layering fiberglass or carbon fiber with resin (requiring a mold and vacuum bagging setup). **Advanced Machining:** Try a fabrication process like waterjet cutting (to cut metal designs) or 4- or 5-axis CNC machining for complex 3D parts. **Robotics/Automation:** Maybe build a small robotic arm or a soft robotic gripper, involving designing the mechanism and possibly using microcontrollers for control. **Electronics/Programming wildcard:** Experiment with something like an FPGA (programmable logic) or machine learning on microcontrollers – for instance, train a simple model to run on your device. **Textiles:** Use digital embroidery machines or computer-controlled knitting machines to create smart textiles, or integrate circuits into fabrics. **Biotech:** Explore the intersection of biology and making – maybe grow a material (like mycelium or kombucha leather) in a digitally fabricated scaffold. Essentially, any process that involves CAD/CAM and results in a tangible output, which wasn’t covered yet, is fair game. You’ll have resources and documentation on various options to guide you.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Individual Assignment:_ **Design and produce something using a digital process not previously covered**. Clearly identify the process you choose and the requirements it entails. For example, if you choose composites, document how you designed the composite lay-up (fiber orientation, layers) and the mold for it, and how you cured it. If you choose a textile project, show the digital pattern you created and how you ran it on a CNC embroidery machine or laser-cut fabric and sewed it. Be sure to **document all steps and parameters** such that someone else could replicate it. In your documentation, include an explanation of why this process is considered “digital fabrication” and what unique capabilities it offers. The outcome could be a standalone artifact or a component for your final project. Demonstrate that you met any specific requirements of the process (for instance, if you did welding, you might show how you computer-designed the pieces to be welded and perhaps used a CNC cutter to prepare them). The goal is to expand your making skills into a new domain and learn how to apply your CAD/CAM knowledge in an unfamiliar context.

## **Module 18: Final Project Development**

With all weekly modules completed, the remaining time is dedicated to finishing your **final project**. This module is more self-directed: you will apply the skills from all previous weeks to build a project that integrates concepts of 2D/3D design, electronics, programming, and system integration. The focus here is on **project management and system integration**: breaking down your final project into tasks, scheduling them, and executing them in time for the final presentation. You should track your progress and iterate as needed (spiral development). This is also the time to troubleshoot any remaining issues and polish your project. The instructors will guide you in managing scope and making sure you meet all requirements.

- **Topics Covered:** **Project Planning:** Revisit the project plan you made in Module 1 and subsequent updates. Enumerate the tasks needed to complete the project and update the schedule – identify what is done and what is left ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_development/index.html#:~:text=Complete%20your%20final%20project%2C%20tracking,when%3F%20what%20have%20you%20learned)). Use project management techniques like triage: decide which features are essential and which can be cut or simplified if time is short ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_development/index.html#:~:text=Project%20management%3A%20Murphy%27s%20Law%2080%2F20%2C,vs%20parallel%20tasks%20system%20integration)). Focus on **system integration**, ensuring that the subsystems (mechanical parts, electronics, software) work together. For example, if your project is a smart device, make sure the sensors, display, and enclosure all fit and function as a unit. **Troubleshooting:** Apply debugging skills – if something isn’t working, systematically diagnose (check power, reprogram microcontrollers, test subsystems in isolation). Utilize peers and instructors for design reviews and problem solving. **Quality and Presentation:** Pay attention to finish and robustness – secure any loose wires, refine any 3D prints or laser-cut parts that didn’t fit perfectly (remake them if necessary), and ensure the project can run reliably for at least the demo. Consider adding final touches like an enclosure or aesthetic improvements now that core functionality is achieved. Throughout this period, document your progress: what problems you encountered and how you solved them, any changes to the original design, etc. ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_development/index.html#:~:text=Complete%20your%20final%20project%2C%20tracking,management%3A%20Murphy%27s%20Law%2080%2F20%2C%2095%2F5)). This documentation will feed into your final project report.
- **Assignments:**
    - _Individual Ongoing Task:_ **Track and document your progress for the final project** ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_development/index.html#:~:text=Complete%20your%20final%20project%2C%20tracking,when%3F%20what%20have%20you%20learned)). Each day or work session, log what you completed and what remains. Answer for yourself (and in your documentation): _What is working? What is not working yet? What questions or uncertainties remain?_ ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_development/index.html#:~:text=Complete%20your%20final%20project%2C%20tracking,when%3F%20what%20have%20you%20learned)) Develop a list of remaining tasks with a timeline (e.g., “Monday: get PCBs soldered, Tuesday: integrate electronics with frame, Wednesday: test software integration,” etc.) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_development/index.html#:~:text=what%20tasks%20have%20been%20completed%2C,Murphy%27s%20Law%2080%2F20%2C%2095%2F5%20triage)). Identify risks or unknowns and resolve them early if possible (for example, if you’ve never tried controlling that high-power motor, do it now to ensure it works as expected). If you find that you will not be able to implement some aspect of your project, adapt the plan (perhaps simplify a feature) so that you can still deliver a complete working project by the deadline. Use the principles of spiral development – build your project in stages, always having a version that works, even if minimally, and then add to it. By the end of this phase, you should have a fully functional project ready to present.

## **Module 19: Final Project Presentation and Delivery**

Congratulations – it’s time to present what you’ve made! In this concluding module, you will finalize all documentation and prepare your project for presentation and evaluation. The emphasis is on thoroughly **documenting your final project** in a page or portfolio that covers the concept, design, implementation, and outcome. You will create a summary slide and a short video demo as required by the class ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_presentation/index.html#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20implications%3F%20Prepare,should%20make%20rather%20than%20buy)). Additionally, you’ll reflect on the project by answering key questions about its purpose, design choices, and future implications ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_presentation/index.html#:~:text=integrates%20the%20range%20of%20units,How%20much%20did%20they%20cost)). The final presentation involves demonstrating the project live (or via video) and explaining how you integrated various skills from the course. This is your opportunity to showcase your ability to “make (almost) anything” by bringing together everything learned throughout the curriculum.

- **Final Documentation Requirements:** Prepare a **comprehensive project page** that would allow someone else to understand and replicate your project ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_presentation/index.html#:~:text=Document%20a%20final%20project%20masterpiece,Where%20did%20they%20come%20from)). This should include: a description of what the project is and what it does ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_presentation/index.html#:~:text=integrates%20the%20range%20of%20units,How%20much%20did%20they%20cost)); background research or inspiration (who else has done something similar?) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_presentation/index.html#:~:text=What%20does%20it%20do%3F%20Who%27s,How%20much%20did%20they%20cost)); a list of all components and materials used (with sources and costs) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_presentation/index.html#:~:text=What%20sources%20did%20you%20use%3F,answered%3F%20What%20worked%3F%20What%20didn%27t)); which parts were designed and made by you (as opposed to off-the-shelf) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_presentation/index.html#:~:text=How%20much%20did%20they%20cost%3F,didn%27t%3F%20How%20was%20it%20evaluated)); the processes you used (2D cutting, 3D printing, etc., showing that you utilized a range of skills); problems encountered and how you fixed or worked around them; and future improvements or implications of your project ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_presentation/index.html#:~:text=What%20tools%20and%20processes%20were,evaluated%3F%20What%20are%20the%20implications)) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_presentation/index.html#:~:text=What%20worked%3F%20What%20didn%27t%3F%20How,one%20minute%20video%20showing%20its)). Include plenty of images: photos of the final assembly, in-process build photos, schematics, code snippets, etc. Ensure that all your design files (CAD files, code, PCB layouts) are linked or uploaded so others can access them.
- **Presentation Preparation:** Create a **single summary slide** that showcases your project (often a collage of a few images with a title and your name) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_presentation/index.html#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20implications%3F%20Prepare,should%20make%20rather%20than%20buy)) – this is used in the final presentation session as a quick visual introduction. Also create a **1-minute video** demonstrating your project in action ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_presentation/index.html#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20implications%3F%20Prepare,should%20make%20rather%20than%20buy)). This video should be concise but show the key features and the project working. Practice a brief verbal presentation: typically you will have a couple of minutes to explain the project live, focusing on what it does and the journey to make it (highlighting how it integrates multiple course topics).
- **Presentation Day:** Present your final project to the class and any guests. Be prepared to answer questions about how it works, what you learned, and what didn’t work. You should be able to point to specific modules – for example, “I designed the PCB in week 7 (Electronics Design) and milled it in week 8 (Production). The case is laser-cut (from Computer-Controlled Cutting week), and the networking aspect uses concepts from the Networking week,” demonstrating the breadth of your skills.
- **Wrap-Up:** Turn in all documentation and ensure your project is **complete and independently operable** (if it was a group project, make sure your individual contributions are clear and that you have documented your own work). After presentations, there’s typically an open house – take pride in what you’ve accomplished and look at what your peers have done too. This final module is all about bringing everything together and celebrating the new capabilities you’ve gained to prototype and create almost anything!


# Courses for each module

## 1. Principles of Digital Fabrication & Final Project Planning

**Resource:** _MIT OpenCourseWare – Digital Fabrication Lecture (MIT Architecture)_ – This lecture gives a broad overview of digital fabrication techniques (CAD/CAM, rapid prototyping, CNC milling, 3D printing, etc.), providing the foundational principles of how digital tools turn designs into physical objects ([Digital Fabrication | Introduction to Design Computing | Architecture | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/4-500-introduction-to-design-computing-fall-2008/resources/lec6/#:~:text=Description%3A)). It helps learners understand the capabilities and workflows of modern fabrication, which is essential for planning a final project’s build approach. Additionally, students are encouraged to start brainstorming and planning their final projects early, considering how various fabrication processes will integrate. In MIT’s maker courses, each student is expected to document skills learned weekly and plan their **final project** as an integration of all those skills ([Learning Program | Fab Academy | Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/about/course.html#:~:text=The%20Fab%20Diploma%20is%20earned,and%20follows%20evolving%20best%20practices)), setting clear project goals and a development roadmap from the outset.

## 2. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) & Parametric Modeling

**Resource:** _“How to CAD (Almost) Anything” – MIT IAP Workshop_ – This free MIT course introduces CAD through fun, practical examples and emphasizes parametric modeling techniques ([How to CAD Almost Anything | Aeronautics and Astronautics | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-16-002-how-to-cad-almost-anything-january-iap-2024/#:~:text=How%20to%20CAD%20Almost%20Anything,object%20into%20a%203D%20model)) ([How to CAD Almost Anything | Aeronautics and Astronautics | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-16-002-how-to-cad-almost-anything-january-iap-2024/#:~:text=This%20supplemental%20resource%20offers%20links,Siemens%20NX%20session%20recordings%C2%A0on%20YouTube)). It covers multiple CAD tools (SolidWorks, Fusion 360, Onshape, NX), teaching how to create 3D models with parametric constraints (dimensions and relationships that can be easily adjusted). The workshop focuses on understanding the design process and choosing strategies to model objects efficiently, rather than just following tutorial steps ([How to CAD Almost Anything | Aeronautics and Astronautics | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-16-002-how-to-cad-almost-anything-january-iap-2024/#:~:text=through%20various%20fun%20examples%20focused,object%20into%20a%203D%20model)). By learning parametric CAD, students can iteratively refine designs for their projects (e.g. adjusting dimensions or features on the fly) and ensure parts will fit together, a critical skill for nearly any fabrication project.

## 3. Project Management & Version Control

**Resource:** _MIT “Missing Semester” – Version Control with Git_ – MIT’s _Missing Semester_ course offers an accessible introduction to project management tools, especially Git for version control.

By following this resource, students learn to use Git to organize their code and design files, back up their work, and coordinate team contributions. These skills ensure that as their project grows in complexity, they can revert mistakes and parallelize work safely – key aspects of effective project management.

## 4. Computer-Controlled Cutting (Laser & Vinyl Cutting)

**Resource:** _MIT Media Lab Laser Cutter Tutorial (MIT OCW)_ – This is a detailed tutorial on operating a laser cutter safely and effectively ([Microsoft Word - Document2](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mas-863-how-to-make-almost-anything-fall-2002/cd0ad333a066267bbcc3d484a1d52a22_Assignment7.pdf#:~:text=The%20laser%20cutter%20is%20a,The%20cutter%20must%20also%20remain)). It covers setup steps, adjusting cutting parameters (speed, power, frequency) for different materials, and cautions like avoiding materials that produce toxic fumes ([Microsoft Word - Document2](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mas-863-how-to-make-almost-anything-fall-2002/cd0ad333a066267bbcc3d484a1d52a22_Assignment7.pdf#:~:text=The%20laser%20cutter%20is%20a,The%20cutter%20must%20also%20remain)) ([Microsoft Word - Document2](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mas-863-how-to-make-almost-anything-fall-2002/cd0ad333a066267bbcc3d484a1d52a22_Assignment7.pdf#:~:text=Particular%20warnings%3A%20Never%20cut%20PVC%2C,internal%20walls%20of%20the%20machine)). By following this tutorial, learners gain practical know-how in preparing design files and running a laser cutter to precisely cut or engrave wood, acrylic, paper, etc. in 2D. Additionally, **vinyl cutting** is introduced through MIT’s Edgerton Center guide, which explains how small CNC cutters use a blade to cut vinyl and other thin materials (cardstock, heat-transfer film, fabric) for decals, stencils, or flexible circuits ([Vinyl/Craft Cutters](https://k12maker.mit.edu/vinylcraft-cutters.html#:~:text=Vinyl%20cutting%2C%20also%20known%20as,shirt%20transfers%2C%20and%20fabric)). Together these resources align with the module by teaching how to produce parts via subtractive 2D processes – from stickers and masks on a vinyl cutter to structural parts on a laser cutter – which students will use to fabricate designs like enclosures, signage, and more.

## 5. Embedded Programming (Microcontrollers Introduction)

**Resource:** _MIT 2.017 Lab – Introduction to Microcontrollers (Arduino)_ – This lab document welcomes students to microcontroller programming using the Arduino platform ([Lab #1: Lab Introduction and Safety, Arduino Microprocessor](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-017j-design-of-electromechanical-robotic-systems-fall-2009/3ccf965e951cf972e6b9e74ba13114b2_MIT2_017JF09_lab1.pdf#:~:text=space%20and%20the%20equipment%20in,check%20out%20Arduino%E2%80%99s%20official%20web)). It explains what a microcontroller is and why Arduinos are popular (ease of use, good balance of capability and cost, huge community) ([Lab #1: Lab Introduction and Safety, Arduino Microprocessor](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-017j-design-of-electromechanical-robotic-systems-fall-2009/3ccf965e951cf972e6b9e74ba13114b2_MIT2_017JF09_lab1.pdf#:~:text=space%20and%20the%20equipment%20in,check%20out%20Arduino%E2%80%99s%20official%20web)). The lab walks through setting up the Arduino, writing simple C code (like blinking an LED), and interfacing with basic components (sensors, motors, etc.) ([Lab #1: Lab Introduction and Safety, Arduino Microprocessor](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-017j-design-of-electromechanical-robotic-systems-fall-2009/3ccf965e951cf972e6b9e74ba13114b2_MIT2_017JF09_lab1.pdf#:~:text=The%20circuits%20in%20the%20Arduino,helpful%20for%20your%20lab%20project)). By working through these exercises, learners become comfortable with embedded programming fundamentals: configuring microcontroller pins, reading sensor inputs, and controlling outputs. This aligns with the module by providing a hands-on introduction to programming the “brains” of a project. After completing the resource, students can confidently program microcontrollers to read sensor data and drive actuators – essential for smart devices and interactive projects.

## 6. 3D Scanning and Printing

**Resource:** _MIT Digital Fabrication Lecture Notes – 3D Scanning & Additive Manufacturing_ – MIT’s course content on 3D scanning and printing covers both the capture of real-world objects and the creation of new objects via additive manufacturing. The notes introduce 3D **scanning** concepts like point clouds, optical triangulation, and generating “watertight” mesh models from scanned data ([academy.cba.mit.edu](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/index.html#:~:text=scanning%20point%20cloud%2C%20triangulation%2C%20watertight%2C,surface%20treatment%20tomography%20Radon%20transform)), which teach how to digitize physical shapes (useful for replicating or modifying existing objects in a CAD environment). On the **3D printing** side, the resource reviews various printing processes and materials – from common fused-filament fabrication (FFF) with plastics to resin-based stereolithography (SLA) and powder-bed sintering ([academy.cba.mit.edu](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/index.html#:~:text=post,crafting%20DED%2C%20WAAM%20Binder%20jetting)). It discusses constraints such as resolution, support structures, material properties, and post-processing ([academy.cba.mit.edu](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/index.html#:~:text=polymer%3A%20PLA%20plant,based%20recyclable%20polymer)) ([academy.cba.mit.edu](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/index.html#:~:text=settings%20lifecycle%20ventilation%20certification%20design,jpg%20%20%2026%20unsupported)). Using this material, students gain an understanding of how to 3D-scan an object and produce a clean model, and how to prepare designs for successful 3D printing. This directly supports the module’s goal by enabling them to both capture objects for remixing and fabricate complex 3D parts for their projects.

## 7. Electronics Design (PCB Design and EDA Tools)

**Resource:** _MIT “Art and Science of PCB Design” Course_ – This IAP course from MIT (available online) teaches the entire workflow of printed circuit board (PCB) design ([Syllabus](https://pcb.mit.edu/syllabus#:~:text=We%20are%20glad%20you%20are,what%20you%20are%20in%20for)) ([Syllabus](https://pcb.mit.edu/syllabus#:~:text=We%20will%20help%20you%20learn,assemble%20and%20debug%20your%20board)). Students learn to use Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools to draw schematics, lay out PCB traces, and apply design rules (like trace widths, clearances, and error checks) for manufacturability. The syllabus highlights that the class is project-focused: each student designs and fabricates a custom PCB from scratch, including schematic capture, board layout, component assembly, and debugging ([Syllabus](https://pcb.mit.edu/syllabus#:~:text=We%20are%20glad%20you%20are,what%20you%20are%20in%20for)). The course materials walk through each step with lectures and hands-on labs, and even include design reviews to improve one’s work. By following this resource, learners align with the module by mastering how to go from an circuit idea to an actual board. They become familiar with EDA software (such as KiCad or Altium), learn about layers, vias, and routing, and understand how to check their designs against electrical and manufacturing rules ([academy.cba.mit.edu](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_design/index.html#:~:text=current%20,Design%20Rule%20check%29%2C%20ERC)). This knowledge is crucial for designing custom electronics (sensor boards, controller boards, etc.) for their projects.

## 8. Electronics Production (PCB Fabrication)

**Resource:** _MIT Fab Lab PCB Fabrication Tutorials_ – The MIT Fab Lab documentation provides step-by-step guidance on fabricating PCBs in-house using computer-controlled milling machines (often a small CNC like a Roland SRM-20). One tutorial describes how to mill a PCB: setting up the copper-clad board, choosing the right end mill (usually a 1/64” bit for engraving fine traces, and a 1/32” bit for cutting the board outline), and adjusting the Z-axis so the tool just cuts through the copper layer ([Week 3: PCB Milling and Assembly](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/EECS/people/natalie/week3.html#:~:text=Please%20see%20%20Alexandre%27s%20site,looking%20more%20like%20an%20etching)) ([Week 3: PCB Milling and Assembly](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/EECS/people/natalie/week3.html#:~:text=I%20used%20the%201%2F32%20bit,an%20exacto%20knife%20later%20on)). It also covers soldering the components onto the milled board and troubleshooting any issues like incomplete cuts or weak solder joints ([Week 3: PCB Milling and Assembly](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/EECS/people/natalie/week3.html#:~:text=Soldering)) ([Week 3: PCB Milling and Assembly](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/EECS/people/natalie/week3.html#:~:text=Programming)). This resource matches the module by showing how to turn a PCB design into a physical board. Learners see both the **prototype fabrication** method (milling/etching a board on-site for quick turnaround) and get insight into professional production considerations (e.g., ensuring proper depth and tool paths, or alternatively sending designs out to a PCB fab house). By practicing with these tutorials, students can produce the custom circuit boards they designed – an important step toward functional electronics in their final projects.

## 9. Molding and Casting

**Resource:** _MIT NEET “Ways of Thinking” – Molding & Casting Demo_ – In this MIT instructional video (and transcript), an instructor demonstrates creating a two-part mold and using it to cast a plaster object ([](https://live.ocw.mit.edu/courses/sp-248-neet-ways-of-thinking-fall-2023/1giHbPQ__mOVASLSSEZxVKp337u7RhECd_transcript.pdf#:~:text=Hello%2C%20my%20name%20is%20Justin,glasses%2C%20scissors%2C%20a%20ruler%2C%20this)) ([](https://live.ocw.mit.edu/courses/sp-248-neet-ways-of-thinking-fall-2023/1giHbPQ__mOVASLSSEZxVKp337u7RhECd_transcript.pdf#:~:text=And%20once%20we%20have%20that,We)). The tutorial uses an example figurine: first, one half of the mold is formed by embedding the item halfway in clay and pouring a skin-safe molding material (alginate) to capture one side. After it cures, the process is repeated to form the second half of the mold ([](https://live.ocw.mit.edu/courses/sp-248-neet-ways-of-thinking-fall-2023/1giHbPQ__mOVASLSSEZxVKp337u7RhECd_transcript.pdf#:~:text=And%20once%20we%20have%20that,We)). Finally, plaster is poured into the completed two-part mold to produce a duplicate of the figurine ([](https://live.ocw.mit.edu/courses/sp-248-neet-ways-of-thinking-fall-2023/1giHbPQ__mOVASLSSEZxVKp337u7RhECd_transcript.pdf#:~:text=remove%20the%20modeling%20clay%2C%20and,about%20to%20cut%20it%20in)) ([](https://live.ocw.mit.edu/courses/sp-248-neet-ways-of-thinking-fall-2023/1giHbPQ__mOVASLSSEZxVKp337u7RhECd_transcript.pdf#:~:text=So%20here%20we%20are,cures%2C%20we%20have%20our%20reproduction)). Throughout the demo, best practices are explained (e.g. establishing a parting line, using registration keys so mold halves align, mixing and curing times, etc.). This resource aligns perfectly with the module, showing how to take a digital or physical model and create a mold for it, then cast parts. For more advanced fabrication, MIT’s fab class also covers machining wax positives and using silicone rubbers (like OOMOO) as mold material ( [jakin learns to make (almost) anything](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.22/Architecture/people/Jakin/week8.html#:~:text=The%20steps%20this%20week%20are,then%20cast%20it%20in%20hydrostone) ) – for instance, milling a wax block to create a mold for casting urethane or hydrostone. By learning from these, students can fabricate complex shapes in materials like plastic, rubber, or metal that would be difficult to make via 3D printing or machining alone.

## 10. Input Devices (Sensors and Measurement)

**Resource:** _MIT Media Lab – Sensor Technologies for Interactive Environments_ – This graduate course (available on OCW) provides a **broad introduction to sensor technology and measurement circuits**. The lecture notes and readings cover how various sensors work and how to interface with them. It spans many modalities: pressure and strain gauges, motion and displacement sensors, environmental sensors (thermal, optical, acoustic), magnetic and electric field sensors, inertial sensors (accelerometers/gyros), bio-signals, etc ([Sensor Technologies for Interactive Environments | Media Arts and Sciences | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mas-836-sensor-technologies-for-interactive-environments-spring-2011/#:~:text=This%20course%20is%20a%20broad,Show%20less)). Crucially, it also discusses the electronics needed for sensors – signal conditioning, amplification, analog-to-digital conversion – and even simple processing algorithms for sensor data ([Sensor Technologies for Interactive Environments | Media Arts and Sciences | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mas-836-sensor-technologies-for-interactive-environments-spring-2011/#:~:text=This%20course%20is%20a%20broad,of%20sensor%20architectures%20%E2%80%A6Show%20more)) ([Sensor Technologies for Interactive Environments | Media Arts and Sciences | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mas-836-sensor-technologies-for-interactive-environments-spring-2011/#:~:text=sensor%20architectures%20and%20modalities%2C%20including,Show%20less)). Using this resource, students gain an understanding of how to select the right sensor for a measurement task and how to read it reliably. For example, they learn how a microcontroller reads a temperature sensor or distance sensor and what circuits are needed to get a clean signal. This knowledge directly supports the Input Devices module: after studying, a student can incorporate sensors into their project (such as a distance sensor on a robot or a touch sensor on an interface) and know how to calibrate and interpret the readings in their software.

## 11. Output Devices (Actuators and Displays)

**Resource:** _MIT Mechanical Engineering – Actuators Lecture (2.72 Elements of Mech. Design)_ – A dedicated lecture on actuators introduces the common output components that enable machines to act upon the world ([Lecture 14: Actuators | Elements of Mechanical Design | Mechanical Engineering | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-72-elements-of-mechanical-design-spring-2009/resources/mit2_72s09_lec14/#:~:text=Lecture%20presentation%20on%20actuators%3A%20DC,coil%2C%20and%20hydraulics)). It discusses electric actuators like DC motors (for rotation or linear motion), piezoelectric devices (for fine movement or vibration), electromagnetic solenoids/coils, and even hydraulic actuators for high force applications ([Lecture 14: Actuators | Elements of Mechanical Design | Mechanical Engineering | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-72-elements-of-mechanical-design-spring-2009/resources/mit2_72s09_lec14/#:~:text=Lecture%20presentation%20on%20actuators%3A%20DC,coil%2C%20and%20hydraulics)). Through this resource, students learn the working principles and use-cases of each type of actuator – e.g. how a DC motor’s speed and torque can be controlled, or how a piezo actuator can create precise movements. This ties into the module by covering how to drive physical action in projects (spinning a fan, moving a robot arm, vibrating an alert, etc.). In addition to mechanical actuators, many projects need **display outputs**. For that aspect, students can leverage simple output device tutorials from introductory electronics courses (for example, controlling an LED or an LCD screen via Arduino is often covered in open-source Arduino guides). Taken together, these resources allow learners to implement output devices in their projects – whether it’s powering a motor, lighting up an info display, or sounding a buzzer – and understand the interface circuits or code required to control them.

## 12. Computer-Controlled Machining (CNC Machining of Large Formats)

**Resource:** _MIT Architecture Shops – CNC Router Tutorial_ – The MIT Architecture fabrication shops provide public tutorials on using large CNC routers for wood and foam. One such guide walks through Mastercam setup for a 3-axis CNC router, covering tool selection, machine setup, and safe operation ([Architecture Shops | Tutorials: Mastercam](https://archshops.mit.edu/mcam.php#:~:text=this%20page)). It explains the differences between various cutting tools (end mills vs. drill bits, etc.) and focuses on the basics needed to mill sheet or block material like plywood, MDF, or foam on a large bed CNC machine ([Architecture Shops | Tutorials: Mastercam](https://archshops.mit.edu/mcam.php#:~:text=this%20page)) ([Architecture Shops | Tutorials: Mastercam](https://archshops.mit.edu/mcam.php#:~:text=It%27s%20extremely%20important%20to%20recognize,end%20mills%20we%27ll%20be%20using)). Key concepts include understanding tool geometry (flutes, shank, cutting length) and how to generate toolpaths that the machine will follow. By studying this, students learn how to take a CAD design (for example, furniture pieces or large enclosures) and generate the CAM instructions for a CNC router. This aligns with the module by enabling fabrication of big or thick parts that laser cutters cannot handle. The resource ensures learners know how to set cutting speeds, choose the right bit for the material, and operate the machine safely to cut out large-format components (like the frame of a CNC, a piece of furniture, etc.) with precision.

## 13. Mechanical Design (Machine Building, Part 1)

**Resource:** _MIT OpenCourseWare – Elements of Mechanical Design_ – This course (2.72) is an advanced look at designing mechanical systems and the fundamental machine elements that comprise them. The course description highlights modeling, design, and integration of components such as **bearings, springs, gears, cams, and mechanisms** ([Elements of Mechanical Design | Mechanical Engineering | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-72-elements-of-mechanical-design-spring-2009/#:~:text=This%20is%20an%20advanced%20course,solid%20%E2%80%A6Show%20more)). By using these materials, students learn how to calculate and choose machine elements that will perform well under the loads and motions required in their project. For example, they might learn how to design a gear train for a desired speed reduction, how to select a bearing to support a rotating shaft, or how to design a spring linkage for a specific range of motion. This directly supports the mechanical design module, especially when building a custom machine: Part 1 (mechanical design) involves creating the physical structure and motion components. With this resource, learners can apply best practices and engineering principles to ensure their machine is mechanically sound (doesn’t bind, bend, or break) and is capable of the intended movement. Essentially, it teaches them how to “make it move” robustly by design, before adding motors or control.

## 14. Machine Design (Automation & Integration, Part 2)

**Resource:** _MIT Mechatronics Course (2.737) – Integrated System Design_ – Mechatronics is all about combining mechanical, electrical, and software systems into one functioning whole, which is exactly the focus of Machine Design Part 2. The MIT Mechatronics course (available via OCW) introduces how to **integrate mechanics with electronics and control software in a unified framework** ([Mechatronics | Mechanical Engineering | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-737-mechatronics-fall-2014/#:~:text=This%20course%20is%20an%20introduction,Show%20less)). Topics include interfacing software with hardware (e.g. microcontroller firmware design), using sensors and actuators together with control algorithms, and managing real-time tasks and feedback loops ([Mechatronics | Mechanical Engineering | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-737-mechatronics-fall-2014/#:~:text=This%20course%20is%20an%20introduction,Show%20less)) ([Mechatronics | Mechanical Engineering | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/2-737-mechatronics-fall-2014/#:~:text=Topics%20covered%20in%20the%20course,Show%20less)). By following this resource, students learn how to take the mechanical design from part 1 and add the electronics and programming needed to automate it. They’ll understand concepts like reading sensor inputs to inform motor outputs (closed-loop control), the basics of digital logic and analog circuits that sit between their microcontroller and mechanical components, and strategies for debugging the whole system. This aligns with the module by guiding learners through the process of turning a static mechanism into an automated machine. In practice, after studying mechatronics, a student can, for instance, build a small automated machine – assembling the frame and moving parts (from module 13) and then wiring up the motors, sensors, and microcontroller and writing code so that the machine performs a coordinated function (e.g. a drawing robot or a mini CNC).

## 15. Networking and Communications

**Resource:** _MIT Media Lab – Sensor Systems (Wired/Wireless Networks)_ – In the context of device networking, the Paradiso course mentioned earlier also touches on wired and wireless communication standards for sensor systems ([Sensor Technologies for Interactive Environments | Media Arts and Sciences | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mas-836-sensor-technologies-for-interactive-environments-spring-2011/#:~:text=sensor%20architectures%20and%20modalities%2C%20including,Show%20less)). It introduces how devices communicate, from simple serial protocols (UART, I²C, SPI for wired microcontroller communications) up to wireless protocols and network standards (like Bluetooth, Zigbee, or Wi-Fi, which are common in IoT). The course places sensors in a network context, explaining how data can be transmitted between modules or to a central hub. More generally, for a foundational understanding of networking, one might look at a computer networks course (e.g. an MIT or Berkeley introductory networking class) to learn about IP networks. However, specific to **maker projects**, a great free resource is the section on networking in the Fab Academy documentation, where students learn to make microcontrollers talk to each other (for example, using asynchronous serial or bus communications) and even connect to the internet. By leveraging these resources, learners fulfill the module by gaining the ability to link multiple devices. They can have boards **network** with each other or send data to a PC/phone. For instance, a final project might involve a sensor node transmitting readings to a display unit wirelessly – with this knowledge, the student can implement that communication reliably. (For a practical exercise, MIT’s class notes on networking show how to set up and code a basic communication between boards, illustrating concepts of addresses, message packets, and synchronization in networks ([Sensor Technologies for Interactive Environments | Media Arts and Sciences | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mas-836-sensor-technologies-for-interactive-environments-spring-2011/#:~:text=sensor%20architectures%20and%20modalities%2C%20including,Show%20less)).)

## 16. Interface and Application Programming

**Resource:** _MIT App Inventor (MIT CSAIL)_ – **App Inventor** is a free, block-based development environment from MIT that lets users create mobile applications through a visual programming interface ([The power of App Inventor: Democratizing possibilities for mobile applications | MIT News | Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://news.mit.edu/2024/power-of-app-inventor-democratizing-possibilities-mobile-applications-0510#:~:text=App%20Inventor%20is%20a%20block,to%20learn%20specialized%20programming%20syntax)). It’s an excellent tool for quickly building a user interface that can communicate with hardware (for example, via Bluetooth to an Arduino, or via a web interface to an IoT device). The block programming approach means students can drag-and-drop logic blocks (for events, actions, UI components, etc.) rather than write code from scratch, greatly lowering the barrier to creating a functional app ([The power of App Inventor: Democratizing possibilities for mobile applications | MIT News | Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://news.mit.edu/2024/power-of-app-inventor-democratizing-possibilities-mobile-applications-0510#:~:text=App%20Inventor%20is%20a%20block,to%20learn%20specialized%20programming%20syntax)). Using App Inventor aligns with this module by enabling learners to develop an **application layer** for their project – such as a smartphone app that controls their device or displays sensor readings. In addition to mobile apps, interface programming can include writing a simple PC program or web dashboard. For instance, resources from p5.js or Processing (originally from MIT Media Lab) teach how to make graphical interfaces or visualizations on a computer. By combining these resources, students can create interactive front-ends for their projects. The end result might be a custom app that a user can interact with (pressing buttons, seeing data) which then sends commands to the project’s hardware – fulfilling the “interface and application” component. App Inventor’s success stories (with millions of users) also reassure that even beginners can build polished apps to complement their hardware projects.

## 17. Wildcard Week (Advanced Digital Fabrication)

**Resource:** _Fab Academy “Wildcard Week” Examples_ – The wildcard week allows students to explore an advanced or specialized fabrication process of their choosing. Authoritative Fab Academy resources highlight several options. For example, **composites** is a popular wildcard topic: students learn to fabricate fiber-reinforced parts by layering fabrics (fiberglass, carbon fiber, etc.) with resin and using vacuum bagging for compaction ([Wildcard week & Fab Academy 2023](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/barcelona/students/manuela-reyes/assignments/wildcard.html#:~:text=This%20week%20was%20the%20most,3d%20printing%2C%20Digital%20embroidery%2C)). Other options have included robotics (building unusual machines or mechanisms), **paste 3D printing** (using a modified 3D printer to extrude clay, dough, or other paste materials), **digital embroidery** (using CNC sewing or weaving machines), and more ([Wildcard week & Fab Academy 2023](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/barcelona/students/manuela-reyes/assignments/wildcard.html#:~:text=This%20week%20was%20the%20most,3d%20printing%2C%20Digital%20embroidery%2C)). A compilation from Fab Academy 2023 notes it was “the most interesting week” with activities like composites, robotic arms, even bioprinting or microfluidics in some cases ([Wildcard week & Fab Academy 2023](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/barcelona/students/manuela-reyes/assignments/wildcard.html#:~:text=This%20week%20was%20the%20most,3d%20printing%2C%20Digital%20embroidery%2C)). These resources (often in the form of tutorials or documentation from prior students and instructors) align with the wildcard module by providing guidance in niche fabrication domains not covered in the core weeks. By diving into one of these, learners get to broaden their skill set – for instance, learning how to make a **composite** skateboard deck or a **silicone mold for chocolate**, or how to do embedded electronics in textiles. The reputable Fab Academy archives (affiliated with MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms) are freely accessible and give step-by-step processes and safety considerations for each wildcard technique, allowing students to independently learn an advanced making skill of their choice.

## 18. Final Project Development

**Resource:** _MIT Fab Academy – Project Development Guide_ – As students build toward their final project, this guide from the Fab Academy (which mirrors MIT’s approach) emphasizes **planning, tracking, and integration**. It advises students to continuously track progress: list what tasks are completed and what remains, evaluate what’s working or not, and identify open questions ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_development/index.html#:~:text=Complete%20your%20final%20project%2C%20tracking,management%3A%20Murphy%27s%20Law%2080%2F20%2C%2095%2F5)). It also introduces project management heuristics like Murphy’s Law (“anything that can go wrong will”), the 80/20 rule (focusing on the 20% of work that yields 80% of results), and triage techniques to decide priorities ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_development/index.html#:~:text=Project%20management%3A%20Murphy%27s%20Law%2080%2F20%2C,vs%20parallel%20tasks%20system%20integration)). A key development strategy highlighted is **spiral development** ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_development/index.html#:~:text=triage%20documentation%20during%20development%20demand,vs%20parallel%20tasks%20system%20integration)) – building the project in iterative loops, starting with a simple version and adding features in increments. By following this resource, learners align with the Final Project Development module by learning how to break their big project into manageable pieces and schedule their time. They’re encouraged to do parallel tasks when possible, but also know when to finish one stage before the next (e.g. get a basic circuit working before embellishing). The guide also reminds students to document as they go and consider **system integration** at each step ([academy.cba.mit.edu](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_development/index.html#:~:text=demand,vs%20parallel%20tasks%20system%20integration)), so that all parts (mechanics, electronics, code) will work together in the end. Using these principles from a reputable source ensures that by the time of final presentations, the student has a well-thought-out project that came together through disciplined planning and iterative improvement.

## 19. Final Project Presentation and Delivery

**Resource:** _Fab Academy Final Project Presentation Requirements_ – To successfully deliver the final project, students must not only finish the build but also present it effectively. Fab Academy (inspired by MIT’s course) requires each student to prepare a one-page **slide** and a short **video** showcasing their final project ([Final project presentation slide and video - Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/oulu/students/aarne-pohjonen/projects/Slide_and_video/#:~:text=Final%20project%20presentation%20slide%20and,final%20project%20is%20shown%20below)). The slide is typically a high-level overview (often 1920×1080 in size) with photos and key points about the project’s features, and the video is around 1 minute, demonstrating the project in action. There are many examples of final presentation slides and videos in the Fab Academy archives ([Final project presentation - Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/agrilab/students/jeancome-picot/final_project_presentation.html#:~:text=Final%20project%20presentation%20,incomeFinal%20ProjectFinal%20project%20presentationFinal)), which serve as guidelines on how to communicate a project succinctly. Additionally, this stage involves wrapping up documentation: writing up the final report, collecting schematics, code, and design files for submission. Resources from MIT on presentation skills (such as tips from the Sloan school or GEL program) can also be helpful – e.g. how to structure a story around the project, and how to speak to an audience about design and results. By adhering to the Fab Academy’s presentation format and taking cues from those authoritative examples, learners fulfill the module by creating a polished presentation of their work. They learn to highlight the problem their project solves, show the fabrication process briefly, and demonstrate the finished product working – all in a concise format. This ensures their final project isn’t just technically complete but also communicated clearly and delivered professionally to peers, instructors, and the wider community. ([Final project presentation slide and video - Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/oulu/students/aarne-pohjonen/projects/Slide_and_video/#:~:text=Final%20project%20presentation%20slide%20and,final%20project%20is%20shown%20below))

- _Machining and CNC Technology_ by Michael Fitzpatrick – (Another relevant text) An introductory textbook that covers the fundamentals of machining processes and introduces CNC programming in a more beginner-friendly manner. It provides context on cutting theory (speeds/feeds), machine setup, and safety, which complements the hands-on learning in the lab when students are cutting wood, plastics, or metals on a CNC.

## 13. Mechanical Design (Machine Building, Part 1)

- _Shigley’s Mechanical Engineering Design_ by Richard Budynas and Keith Nisbett – The classic machine design textbook used in mechanical engineering programs. It is **intended for students beginning the study of mechanical design** and covers stress analysis, material selection, and the design of machine elements like shafts, gears, bearings, springs, etc. ([Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design: 9781260569995 ...](https://www.amazon.com/Shigleys-Mechanical-Engineering-Design/dp/1260569993#:~:text=Shigley%27s%20Mechanical%20Engineering%20Design%20is,study%20of%20mechanical%20engineering%20design)). This directly supports the machine-building module by giving students the analytical tools to design structural and moving parts of their projects. For example, if a student is building a small machine, Shigley’s can guide how to size components so they are strong enough and function properly.
- _Design of Machinery_ by Robert L. Norton – (Alternate or additional resource) A textbook focusing on kinematics and mechanism design (linkages, cams, gear trains). It is useful for the “Machine Building” context because it teaches how to design the motion and mechanical functionality of machines. Together with a strength-of-materials text like Shigley’s, it helps students create machines that not only stand up mechanically but also achieve the desired motions (e.g., a custom 3D printer or drawing robot mechanism).

## 14. Machine Design (Automation & Integration, Part 2)

- _Automation, Production Systems, and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing_ by Mikell P. Groover – A comprehensive text on factory automation and the integration of mechanical systems with control and computer systems. It provides advanced coverage of how machines and robots are automated and coordinated in manufacturing ([Automation, Production Systems, and Computer Integrated ... - eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/126859563201#:~:text=%2AFor%20advanced%20undergraduate%2F%20%2Agraduate,Integrated%20Manufacturing)). This aligns with the second part of machine design, where students integrate electronics and automation into their mechanical systems. Concepts such as stepper/servo control, feedback loops, and even basic robotics from this book can inform their automated machine projects (e.g., a self-feeding machine or an XY plotter with computerized control).
- _Mechatronics: Electronic Control Systems in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering_ by W. Bolton – Emphasized earlier for sensors/actuators, this book is also relevant here as it demonstrates how to **marry mechanical design with electronics and programming** into one cohesive system ([Mechatronics: electronic control systems in mechanical and ...](https://dokumen.pub/mechatronics-electronic-control-systems-in-mechanical-and-electrical-engineering-6nbsped-9781292076683-9781292081595-9781292081601-1881881881-5355375375-1292076682-1292081597.html#:~:text=Mechatronics%3A%20electronic%20control%20systems%20in,1%29)). It covers PLCs, control theory, and system integration at a level useful for students building an automated machine. This systems perspective ensures that in Part 2 of machine design, students pay attention to how the mechanical, electronic, and software components of their project work together reliably.

## 15. Networking and Communications

- _Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach_ by James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross – A leading textbook in computer networks, known for its accessible top-down teaching style. It covers Internet architecture, protocols (HTTP, TCP/IP, etc.), and wireless networking. This book is **used by over one hundred thousand students worldwide** to learn networking ([[PDF] Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition](https://www.ucg.ac.me/skladiste/blog_44233/objava_64433/fajlovi/Computer%20Networking%20_%20A%20Top%20Down%20Approach,%207th,%20converted.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20Computer%20Networking%3A%20A%20Top,thousand%20students%20and%20practitioners%20worldwide)). For this module, it gives a solid foundation in how devices communicate. Students can learn, for example, how to network their microcontrollers or use protocols to make their projects talk to each other or to a server.
- _Data Communications and Networking_ by Behrouz A. Forouzan – (Alternate text) Another widely used book that provides a broad introduction to communication networks, including serial communication, networking hardware, and internet technologies. It can help students implement networking in their projects (such as sending sensor data to a web application or using Wi-Fi modules) by understanding the necessary protocols and data formats.

## 16. Interface and Application Programming

- _Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists_ by Casey Reas and Ben Fry – An introduction to programming interactive graphics and interfaces using the Processing language. It is written in the context of the visual arts and creative media, making it very approachable for designing GUIs or visual programs ([Processing](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262028288/processing/#:~:text=The%20new%20edition%20of%20an,language%20Processing%3B%20thoroughly%20updated%20throughout)). This aligns with the interface programming module by enabling students to quickly create software that can communicate with their hardware. For example, students might use Processing (or p5.js, its JavaScript cousin) to build a simple interface that sliders sensor values or visualizes data from their project in real time.
- _Designing the User Interface_ by Ben Shneiderman et al. – (Additional resource for UI/UX) A classic HCI textbook that covers principles of human-computer interaction, interface design guidelines, and evaluation. While not hardware-specific, it helps students in this module consider how to make their applications user-friendly – for instance, how to layout controls on a screen or design responsive interactions for their final project software.

## 17. Wildcard Week (Advanced Digital Fabrication Option)

- _Digital Fabrication in Architecture, Engineering and Construction_ by Luca Caneparo – An advanced reference that presents **innovative digital fabrication technologies** and case studies in architecture and engineering ([Digital Fabrication in Architecture, Engineering and Construction | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-007-7137-6#:~:text=,for%20design%20and%20construction%20courses)). It serves as a “snapshot” of cutting-edge fabrication methods (such as robotic construction, custom 5-axis CNC, or novel materials) and is even noted as a suitable reference for design courses. This book can inspire and inform whatever special topic the Wildcard week involves – be it composites layup, textile fabrication, bio-printing, or another emerging fab technology – by showing real-world examples and the principles behind them.
- _(Varies by chosen topic)_ – Depending on the specific advanced option a student pursues, other specialized texts may be relevant. For example, if the wildcard involves **composite materials**, _Composite Materials: Science and Engineering_ by Krishan Chawla would be a relevant textbook. If it involves **bio-fabrication or wearables**, texts like _Biomaterials Science_ or _Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing_ ([Rapid Prototyping: Principles And Applications (Third Edition) (With Companion Cd-rom) / Edition 3 by Chee Kai Chua, Kah Fai Leong, Chu Sing Lim | 9789812778987 | Paperback | Barnes & Noble®](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/rapid-prototyping-chee-kai-chua/1123814204#:~:text=Rapid%20prototyping%20,can%20test%20his%20or%20her)) could provide deeper background. The key is that this week is supported by a resource that dives deeper into the particular advanced method the student is exploring.

## 18. Final Project Development

- _Product Design and Development_ by Ulrich & Eppinger – (Revisited) This textbook is extremely useful during final project development, as it guides students through prototyping, iterative design, and project economics. Chapters on prototyping and design-for-manufacture help students refine their projects for the final presentation. The text is known for its balanced, methodical approach and is **widely used around the world** for teaching the product development process ([Steven D. Eppinger - MIT Sloan Individual Faculty Site](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/eppinger/books/#:~:text=Product%20Design%20and%20Development%20is,used%20by%20hundreds%20of%20universities)). By following its structured approach (concept selection, testing, etc.), students can systematically develop their final prototypes and ensure their projects meet user needs and constraints before the final deadline.
- _Engineering Design Communications_ by Edward J. Roth – (Additional) A handbook focusing on documenting and communicating design intent. It covers how to write design reports, maintain an engineering notebook, and prepare technical documentation. This supports project development by ensuring students keep track of their process and can effectively communicate their design choices and improvements leading up to the final delivery.

## 19. Final Project Presentation and Delivery

- _The Craft of Scientific Presentations: Critical Steps to Succeed and Critical Errors to Avoid_ by Michael Alley – A guide specifically tailored to presenting technical projects. It aims to strengthen engineers and scientists in oral presentations ([The Craft of Scientific Presentations - SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8279-7#:~:text=The%20Craft%20of%20Scientific%20Presentations%2C,presenter%20of%20science%20and%20engineering)), covering how to structure a talk, design effective slides, and engage an audience. This is ideal for the final stages of the course when students must present their projects and demonstrate their prototypes. By applying Alley’s advice (for example, focusing each slide on a clear message and avoiding common pitfalls), students can deliver a compelling final presentation of their work.
- _Presentation Zen_ by Garr Reynolds – (Another popular reference) While not an academic textbook per se, it is widely referenced for improving presentation design and delivery. It encourages simplicity in slides, storytelling, and strong visual communication. Using such guidance in tandem with the technical content, students can elevate the professionalism and clarity of their final project presentations and showcase “almost anything” they made in the best light.

Each of these textbooks provides a deep dive into the module’s subject matter, reinforcing the weekly hands-on work with theory, best practices, and examples. By consulting these texts, students can gain both the foundational knowledge and the practical insights needed to successfully “make (almost) anything.” Each resource is well-recognized in academia or industry, ensuring the learning aligns with broadly accepted standards and techniques in the field.
